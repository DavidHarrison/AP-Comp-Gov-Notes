# Russia-Mexico Comparison
- Both once one-party states
- Mexico is never as repressive as Russia
	- Mostly not violent (executions, imprisonment etc.)

## Mexico
Economic Slowdown > Oil Boom > Economic Crisis > Economic Liberalization > Political Liberalization
- Forced to privatize to pay debts

## Russia
Economic Stagnation > Limited Economic Reform > Political Reform > Economic Liberalization > Economic Crisis > "Reassertion" of greater political and economic control of the state
- Political reform happens before economic reform (reverse of Mexico)
- Political liberalization causes USSR to breakup
- Economic liberalization done on an ideological basis (not out of necessity like Mexico)
