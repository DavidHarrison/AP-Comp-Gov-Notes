British Political Parties
=========================

i.  Labour

    A. Originally, a socialist party and the political arm of the trade
    union movement

    B. Today, a non-ideological, center-left party. Unprepared to change
    the neo-liberal economic arragnements put in place by Thatcher and
    Major (179-1997)

ii. Conservative (Tory)

    A. Before the 1970s a pragmatic, non-ideological party accepted most
    of the nationalizations and welfare state programs adopted by the
    post-war Labour government

    B. Under Thatcher, the Conservatives became an ideologically
    neo-liberal party commited to privitization of state owned
    enterprises reducing the tax and wage burden faced by British
    businesses and ending what Thatcher saw as union control of the
    British economy

    C. Today, PM Cameron is enforcing financial austerity (tax hikes and
    budget cuts) to address Britain's budget problems

    -   Labour government ran huge deficits from 2007-2010 to stimulate
        the economy during the Global Financial Crisis (Keynesian demand
        management, or Keynesian macro-economic policy tools)

iii. The Liberal Democrats

    A. Result from merger of the Liberals and the Social Democrats
    (disaffected Labour Party moderates) in the 1980s

    B. In opposition, they take positions often to the left of Labour on
    health and education spending, gay marriage and in opposition to the
    war in Iraq. In power with the Conservatives, they act as a brake on
    Conservative austerity policies.

    -   For proportional representation (would put them in continuous
        coalition with \~20% of the vote)
