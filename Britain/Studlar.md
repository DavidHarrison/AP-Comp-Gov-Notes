Studlar - UK Constitutional Reform
==================================

Change Since Article
--------------------

1.  British Supreme Court (2009)
    -   find interpretation of laws adopted by Parliament
    -   no power of judicial review

2.  Devolution of further powers to Welsh Assembly and Northern Irish
    Assembly
    -   Northern Irish Assembly has almost full powers
        -   Previously had assembly until 1970s in The Troubles

    -   **not** federalism

3.  Further House of Lords reform effectively shelved
    -   Lib Dems for fully elected House of Lords
    -   Labour and Conservatives do not want elected House of Lords
    -   Elected HoL would give legitimacy to the HoL and thus
        justification for power

4.  Prime Minister no longer has power to call an election (Lib Dem
    measure). Parliament just sit for full five year term unless
    -   House of Commons votes not confidence in government; or
    -   House of Commons votes by 2/3 to call election
