British Government
==================

I.  The British Constitution

    A.  The UK has no written constitution; consists of laws passed by
        Parliament, court cases and traditions (Bill of Rights etc)

    B.  Can be changed by act of Parliament

-   Tradition is sufficient to justify system
-   Parliament has power over the courts

II. Parliamentary Sovereignty
    -   Power to overrule courts or super-national organizations
    -   Public opinion ensures basic laws are followed

III. Westminster Model of Government
    -   used by other governments including Canada

    A.  House of Commons consists of 650 members, each elected in a
        single-member district by plurality (FPTP)

    B.  The House of Commons chooses the PM - he or she is the head of
        the largest party in Commons (which usually has a majority)

    C.  The PM appoints MPs to ministerial positions; usually about 1/4
        of the MPs from the majority party/parties hold positions; as
        ministers or junior ministers

    -   When PM dies/resigns, PM is chosen by the party

    D.  The ministers, junior ministers and senior civil servants who
        assist them are called "the Government". They sit on the front
        benches in the House of Commons; Members of the majority
        party/parties who are not in ministerial positions are called
        "back benchers"

    E.  The PM and the most senior ministers comprise "the Cabinet"

    F.  The leader of the opposition is generally expected to become PM
        if his party wins a majority of seats in the next election; he
        appoints the "shadow cabinet"

    -   mostly, party leaders do not survive electoral defeats

    G.  Key decisions are made at Cabinet meetings (PM has final say).
        Ministers unable to support a decision in public are expected to
        resign from the cabinet.

    H.  Individual cabinet members are responsible for the policy
        failures of the ministries they supervise (previously would have
        been expected to resign)
        -   Britain serves as bridge between US and Europe
        -   cabinet ministers are often moved around
        -   Civil Service

        1.  senior civil servants are powerful and don't change because
            MPs are few and change often
        2.  civil servants remain neutral
        3.  Power of the civil service has eroded in recent years

    I.  The cabinet is collectively responsible for the Government
        policies

    J.  The Legislative Process
        1.  policy innovations are developed in ministries by minister
            and senior civil servants and submitted to cabinet for
            approval
        2.  legislation is developed by cabinet members and senior civil
            servants and submitted to the cabinet for approval
        3.  legislation introduced into the House of Commons, where it
            is debated and approved
        4.  bills with major flaws are withdrawn and reintroduced, not
            amended during House of Commons debate

    -   Prime minister controls MPs with power over their seats

        5.  Imposition of the Whip
            -   severity indicated by underlines (1, 2, 3)
            -   issue of confidence, a loss requires government to
                resign

        6.  "Free Votes"
            -   no party line (moral issues etc) (eg capital punishment,
                homosexuality, abortion)

IV. The House of Lords

    A.  Composition (\~765 members)
        1.  92 hereditary peers (out of 750 before 1990s)

        -   senior judges removed

        2.  26 archbishops and bishops (of Church of England)
        3.  Balance is "life peers" (appointed for life)
            -   mostly for service to country (politics, civil service,
                military)

    B.  Party Membership
        1.  \~1/3 Labour
        2.  \~1/3 Conservative
        3.  \~1/10 Lib Dems
        4.  \~1/4 no affiliation

    C.  House of Lords has power to delay but not defeat legislation
        -   only significant in the last year of a Government
        -   no power over budget
        -   sometimes used for debate before introduction to House of
            Commons

V.  The Queen: ceremonial head of state

    A. Symbol of national unity - head of state of many former colonies
    -   head of Commonwealth

    B.  Opens Parliament every year - gives speech from the throne
        (written by Government)

        -   does not express political opinion
