Devolution
==========

-   Power Devolved to Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, and Northern
    Irish Assembly

Why?
----

1.  Assumed by Labour to be politically popular
    -   Conservative party is very weak in Scotland
    -   Scotland and Wales vote heavily labour (along with the North)

-   Originally from the 1960s
    -   voted down by regional voters

2.  Combat Seperatism
	-   Nationalism
    		-   Scotland
        	-   SNP
        	-   \~20-30% support for independence

    	-   Wales
        	-   Plaid Cymraeg
        	-   \< 10% support

	-   Especially in Scotland
	-   Not likely to have significant effect in Norther Ireland

	-   Low population in Scotland (\~5.3 million), Wales (\~3 million), and
    N. Ireland (\~1.8 million)

3.  It's Fair ("subsidarity")
	-   Government descisions should be made at the lowest level possible
    		-   People have more say

Not Federalism
--------------

1.  British Parliament created and established the powers of the
    Scottish Parliament, the Welsh National Assembly and the Northern
    Irish Assembly; it can abolish these bodies and change their powers
    at will.

2.  Power delegated asymmetrically

	-   Only Scottish Parliament can levy taxes
	-   Scottish and Northern Irish Assembly have full power to legislate
	-   Power: Scottish Parliament \> Northern Irish Assembly \> Welsh
    Assembly
	-   US: Powers delegated **upwards**
    	-   All states have the same powers

	-   UK: Powers delegated **downwards**

3.  Powers delegated are limited

	-   Scotland can only tax up to 3%

Scotland
--------

1.  All domestic policy making has been devolved to the Scottish
    Parliament (much business regulation done by EU)

	-   Health
	-   Education
    		-   Maintained free university education while Blair government
        instituted tuition and Cameron Government raised it

	-   Justice
    		-   Own courts, judges and prisons

	-   Taxation

2.  Power of taxation limited to 3%

	-   The West Lothian Problem
    		-   Scottish MPs vote on policy that only effects England and Wales
        that do not effect Scotland
    		-   No English Parliament
    		-   Last Labour government only had majority with Welsh and Scottish
        MPs

### Scottish Parliament

-   129 Seats
-   73 elected by plurality in SMDs
-   56 elected by PR in 8 multimember districts
-   Why
    -   SMD -\> two party system of SNP and Labour
    -   Canada - Quebec
        -   Partie Quebecois annonces referendum on independence
            -   People and money leaves the province
            -   Partie Quebecois loses next election

    -   PR keeps SNP from holding referenda on independence
    -   Referendum to be held in 2014
        -   Debate over 16/17 year old voting

Wales
-----

1.  Law making authority now delegated in most areas
    -   As of 2011, can approve their own legislation (not through
        national parliament)

2.  No tax authority

### Welsh Assembly

-   Hybrid electoral system (FPTP and PR)
-   Currently Labour minority
    -   Previously Labour/Nationalist coalition

Northern Ireland
----------------

-   Good Friday Agreement (1999)
    -   Nationalists, Unionists, UK government, Irish government, US
        government
    -   More or less ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland
    -   British Army originally entered N. Ireland in 1960s to protect
        Catholics, attacked by IRA as army of occupation
    -   IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups renounce violence and
        give up their weapons
    -   Voters or N. Ireland vote to establish a Northern Irish Assembly
        which will eventually (and now does) have power to legislate on
        all domestic policy issues
    -   Voters of Ireland vote to give up Ireland's constitutional claim
        to N. Ireland
    -   Voters in both Ireland and N. Ireland vote to establish and
        all-island body to address issues of concern to all people on
        the island of Ireland
    -   Remains part of the UK, with some issues arbitrated by all-Irish
        body, and in most issues will be self governing

### Northern Irish Assembly
- Election for Northern Irish Assembly is PR
- Parties
	- Hardline Unionist
	- Softer Unionist
	- Alliance - move beyond division
	- Softer Nationalist Party
	- Sinn Fein - hardline nationalist (ties to IRA)
		- elects five members of UK Parliament who refuse to take their places
- All parties must be represented in cabinet in proportion to vote and assembly
- Members of assembly declare Unionist, Nationalist, Other
- To pass legislation, majority + 40% Unionist and 40% Nationalist
- Traditionally, moderate parties win most of the vote
- Most recent vote hardline of both won
	- Issued ultimatum by UK Parliament; agreed to work together to maintain N. Irish independence
	- Agree that more UK Government money should be spent in N. Ireland, want to look attractive to US investment
