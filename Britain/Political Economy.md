British Political Economy Since 1945
------------------------------------

I.  The Socialist Government (1945-1951)

    A.  Nationalization of key industries

    B.  Establishment of the welfare state
    	1.  Child benefit, free university tuition and social housing
    	2.  The National Health Service

    C.  Retention of price controls, wage controls and rationing; limited
    use of central planning

    D.  Keynesian demand management (adjustment of interest rates, taxes
    and spending) to attempt to ensure full employment and low inflation

II.  The Collectivist Consensus (1951-1979)

    A.  Utilities publicly owned; enterprises in money losing industries
    (eg, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding) nationalized to
    preserve jobs

    B.  Welfare state retained and expanded

    C.  No control of the economy through price controls or rationing
    	1.  Governments sought voluntary wage restraint from unions
    	2.  Voters thought Labour better able to achieve wage restraint than
        Conservatives
    	3.  Continuation of Keynesian demand management policies

    D.  Accession to the European Economic Commnunity (now the European
    Union)
    	-   supported by moderates on both sides as well as Lib Dems
    	-   opposed by the far left and far right E. Stop/Go (rapid
        switching of Keynesian management extremes) in the 1960s turned
        into stagflation (stagnation + inflation) in the 1970s; 1978-79
        	- The Winter of Discontent
    	-   Union demands greater wage increases than the increase in cost
        of living and increase in output; results in inflation
    	-   Middle East causes oil prices jump; affects all of the West

III.  Neo-liberalism ("Thatcherism") and the Conservatives (1979-1997)
    -   No obligations to others in society other than those who you
        take volutary responsibilty for (family) ("There is no society")
    -   Americanize Britain

    A.  Profitable state-owned enterprises privatized; unprofitable
    government enterprises shut down

    B.  Concerted effort to break the power of the unions
    	1.  Legal reform
    	2.  Holding fast during strikes (eg coal miners)

    C.  Retreat from Keynesian policy (monetarism)

    D.  Tax cuts (esp. on business), social service cuts and increased
    economic inequality

    E.  Suspicion of the EU (approval of common market; dislike of
    "regulation from Brussels" and integration projects)

IV.  "New Labour": Tony Blair's "Third Way" (1997-2010)

    A.  Acceptance of the neo-liberal economy

    B.  At first, acceptance of budget limits established by
    Conservatives; as economy grew
    	1.  slight tax increases on middle class and slight tax cuts on
        workers (to cool off economy during boom and to redistribute
        income)
    	2.  spending increases on education and health

    C.  Promotion of labor market flexibility
    	1.  Low cost of employment beyond wages
    	2.  Easy rules about part-time work and overtime
    	3.  Maintenance of distance from unions (and largely non-union work
        force)

    D.  Targeted incentives for new industries (IT, biotech,
    pharmaceuticals)
    	1.  Maintencance of London's global dominance in financial services
    	2.  Weak manufacturing - low wage, low value-added, low cost goods
        	-   Mostly small appliance

    E.  Gordon Brown's rediscovery of Keynesian policy tools and
    nationalization during the global financial crisis (2008-2010) 
    	- Housing boom from overbuilding in Ireland and Spain
    	- G20 Agreements on economic policy to avoid a second Great Depression
    	- US uses nationalizations and Keynesianism as well
    	- 2003-2008 2-3% of GDP\
    	- 2011 11% GDP \* National Debt 30% - 37% of GDP under New Labour\
    	- Now \~75% of GDP - Similar to US - Italy and Greece \~100% - Japan
    	\~200% \* Mortgage debt worse in UK than US in 2007

v.  The Coalition Government: Cameron's "Big Society" (2010-present)

    A. Financial austerity as a response to growth in deficit and debt
    during the crisis
    1.  At Liberal-Democrats insistence, taxes increased on middle class
        while income tax threshold increased
    2.  Weak progress on deficit reduction - budget cuts and tax hikes
        increase unemployment, leadin to greater demand for social
        services and lower tax revenues
        -   \~1 million jobs lost (\~50% Public, \~50% Private)
        -   No significant progress on debt reduction (less taxes, more
            social services)

    -   Slipped in and out of recession \~5 times

    3.  Privitization of Post Office as a means of raising funds

    B. More modest targeted incentives for new industries \* Cash
    incentives to 8 industries (\~\$1bn)

    C. Encouragement of volunteerism to take the place of state-funded
    social services (Big Society) \* School choice (non-profits) - from
    Sweden in 1990s + Britain less egalitarian than Sweden giving
    different results - schools may try to avoid poor and immigrant
    children
    -   US economy has rebounded faster than UK
        -   \~7-8% unemployment in both
            -   both are a bit lower (those not actively looking for
                work)
