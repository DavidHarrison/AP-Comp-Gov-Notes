British Society
===============

i.  Social Class

    A. In the 20th century most Britons saw themselves as:
    1.  Middle Class: professionals, managers, businessmen, merchants
    2.  Working Class: skilled and unskilled labour

    -   more social mobility in UK than in US
    -   middle class not same as US

    B. Voting Behaviour determined by class
    1.  Middle class overwhelmingly voted Conservative
    2.  2/3 of the working class voted Labour
        -   Conservatives tended to be more skilled and better payed

    -   Working class historically did not necessarily want to be middle
        class; motivated by standard of living rather than oppurtunity

    C. The Embodiment of working class aspirations was the trade union
    movement. The unions founded the Labour Party as a socialist party
    (officialy socialist 1905 - 1990s)

    D. Social class has faded as the fundamental organizing principle of
    British society
    1.  Growing affluence and social mobility starting in the late 1950s
    2.  Thatcher's "oppurtunity society" "There is no such thing as
        society"
    3.  Thatcher's successful attack on trade union power (borrowed
        American policy)
    4.  Labour's growing independence from the trade unions
        (deindustrialization resulted in less power for the unions)

ii. Race in Britain

    A. 9.1 million people (1/7 of UK; 1/6 of England and Wales) are of
    Afro-Carribean, South Asian or East Asian ancestry

    B. Historically subjected to racism

    C. Increasingly well integrated but Pakistani- and
    Bangladeshi-Britons to a lesser extend (Muslim)

    D. Tend to vote Labour

    E. Nearly 1m white imigrants to UK as well (Eastern European EU
    members (eg Poland))

iii. Religion
    -   Not a religious society
        -   minority will respond that a god exists

    -   15% of population regularly attends church services
    -   Northern Ireland
        -   60% Protestant - mostly Unionist
        -   40% Catholic - mostly Seperatist
        -   violence has decreased in the last 10 years

iv. Gender
    -   Both parties have tried to promote women in politics
        -   Conservatives less active
        -   Labour more actively with suggesting primarily female
            candidates
        -   mostly symbolic, with candidates rather than issues
