Iranian Economy
===============

-   in 2002 Iran allowed 100% foreign ownership of businesses
    -   Shah had done

Dependency ("Dependencia") Theory -- Guillermo O'Donnell
--------------------------------------------------------

-   evolved to describe Latin American economics
-   popular in the 1970s, fell out of popularity in the 1980s
-   belief that West is innately culturally and economically imperialist
-   believe that emerging economies should not trade with the West
    -   can trade within emerging markets

-   has echoes today, in the critique of American policies in left-wing
    governments of S. America

### Theory

-   developing nations export raw materials to the West in exchange for
    finished goods
-   over time the value of these raw materials falls relative to the
    price of finished goods
-   if the price of a raw material becomes too high, the West will find
    a way to not be dependent on it

-   many countries, such as Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina, were once
    relatively

-   the West produces products that require skills and good education

-   China is now seen in the way the US was in the 1940s
    -   looks for raw materials and markets
    -   makes deals with local elites

-   helps explain why the West grew rich while the developing nations
    stayed poor
    -   countries that depend on one or few exports are hostage to the
        world markets
        -   Nigeria, Iran, previously Mexico
            -   Mexico diversified

        -   during the economic downturn of 2008, Mexico suffered worst
            out of Latin America because of its dependence on the US

Shah's Regime
-------------

-   In 1979, oil exports generated 97% of Iran's earning of foreign
    currency. Oil exports financed 80% of the state budget.
    -   needs to buy food (even though Revolutionary regime has reduced
        food import dependence)

-   Under the Shah, Iran became a Rentier state -- a government that
    depends on the sale of natural resources to finance its operations
    -   Rentier states do not fund significant portions of their
        operations from tax revenues
        -   causes them to be disconnected from the societies they
            governe
        -   Shah was disconnected from people

    -   still a Rentier state

-   From the White Revolution to the "Islamic" Revolution, Iran's
    economy grew rapidly (\~9.6% annual increase in GDP)
    1.  Improved diet and falling infant mortality led to a population
        explosion -- the population doubled between 1959 and 1979
    2.  The Shah pursued "trickle-down" economic policies that did
        little to help the rural poor (who were becoming urban informal
        sector workers)
        -   the elites bought largely from the West
        -   Land reform failed: plots too small to allow farm families
            to support themselves (let alone repay loans)
        -   Doctors (from Shah's training programs) concentrated in
            Tehran (serving wealthy and middle class); Iran has one of
            the highest infant mortality rates in the Middle East

    -   40% of children attend primary school; literacy remains at about
        1/3 of population
    -   Iran becomes one of the most unequal societies in the world
        -   Income inequality (urban to rural): 5 to 1
        -   Income inequality (wealthiest (Tehran) to poorest
            (Baluchestan) province): 10 to 1
        -   Income inequality within cities huge -- and growing in 1979

    -   Resentment of the Shah and the luxurious lifestyle he leads
        grows
        -   feeling that the Shah is following consumerist Westernism
        -   un-Islamic
        -   Shah seen as puppet of the West

The Economic Policies of the "Islamic" Regime
---------------------------------------------

I.  From 1979 to 1988, policy emphasizes the role of the government in
    the economy
    A.  Necessitated by the War with Iraq

    -   still, there is a divide between economic liberals and
        nationalists in government

    B.  In the 1980s, the state
        1.  rationed hard currency
        2.  set prices for consumer goods
        3.  used state-owned banks to incest in key economic sectors
        4.  redistributed the assets of those who had fled the country

II. From 1989 to 2005, a much more liberal economic policy is pursued by
    two reform-minded presidents Rasfanjani (moderate conservative)
    (1989-1997) and Khatami (1997-2005); greater emphasis is placed on
    the private sector and market mechanisms for allocating resources
    A.  The new approach results from
        1.  the end of the war with Iraq (no need to devote resources to
            the war, weakens position of statists)
        2.  the rise of neo-liberal economic theory globally
        3.  the poor performance of the economy after 1985 (due to the
            fall in oil prices)
            a.  GDP falls 50%; per-capita incomes fall 45%
            b.  the real value of pensions and incomes falls 60%
                (inflation runs at \~20-30% a year)

        c.  unemployment at 20%
        d.  rural poverty forces millions into Iran's cities (Tehran's
            population increases from 4.2 million to 12 million between
            1979 and 1989)

    B.  In response, Rasfanjani and Khatami try to liberalize Iran's
        economy
        1.  Privitization of SOEs

        2.  Lifting of trade restrictions
        3.  Encouragement of private and foreign investment
            -   SOE managers and workers resisted privitization
                -   privatization would put pressure to fire workers
                -   SOEs retain their privileged access to investment
                    funds and resources

            -   Privatization often transferred SOEs to bonyads
                (religious foundations) and the Revolutionary Guards -
                profits from the bonyads used to fund the foundation's
                social programs - 1/4 to 1/3 of the economy is owned by
                the Revolutionary Guards
            -   the success of privatization of SOEs limited

    -   with Ahmadinejad, swing against liberalism
        -   success of Ahmadinejad was based not on social conservatism,
            but opposition to liberalism

Economic Failures of the Islamic Republic
-----------------------------------------

1.  Iran is still a Rentier state
    -   Dependent on the sale of oil for almost all hard currency and to
        fund government operations
        -   Iran's oil reserves are running out
        -   Iran needs the technology and capital (like Mexico) from the
            West
            -   could get the needed capital from China (who do not need
                to follow US sanctions)

2.  In the early 1980s, the new regime encouraged large families -- and
    Iran had the highest birth rate in the world. This strained public
    services
    -   under the Shah, family planning was promoted, though not terribly
        successful
    -   the Revolutionary government declares family planning un-Islamic
        -   initially thought to be good to have more youth to fight
            Iraq

    -   after the start of baby boom, promoting a two-child family,
        causing birth rates to drop

3.  The economic crisis of the '80s left Iran \$30 billion in debt
4.  Three million Iranians left the country in the years after the
    Revolution. Iran continues to lose 180,000 people/year to emigration
    -   mostly well-educated middle-class professionals
    -   flee for economic and political reasons

Economic Successes of the Islamic Regime
----------------------------------------

1. Rapid expansion of road network and automobile ownership
    - more than 100x more cars now than in 1979
2. 95% of the population has access to healthcare; 100% of the population has access to sanitation services; more than 90% have potable water in their homes
    - Infant mortality fell from 104/1000 (third world level) to 26/1000 (slightly high for a middle income country)
    - Life expectancy is now 72 years (was 55 in 1979)
        - heavily affected by infant mortality
3. Literacy has improved
    - 89% of males (over 15) literate
    - 81% of females (over 15) literate
    - difference between males and females is attributable to pre-Revolutionary education
    - universal literacy among Iranians under 40
    - young women tend to better educated than young men
4. Differences in living standards have narrowed
    - both urban-rural and urban-urban gaps have narrowed
5. Iran has achieved near self-sufficiency in food production
    - only done by depleting ground water; food production is unsustainable
6. Iran has also re-oriented its trade from US and Europe to: China, India, Turkey, S. Korea, Japan and the UAE
7. Iran today has a very low birth rate -- population increasing at a rate of 1.2% per year (comparable to Mexico)
