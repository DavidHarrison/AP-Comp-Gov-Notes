Early Iranian History
=====================

-   has existed in one form or another for \~2500 years
-   created by Cyrus and Darius
-   has been known in the West as Persia
    -   majority speaks Farsi, from province of Pars
    -   people in Iran have referred to the country as Iran for
        \~1700-1800 years
    -   Iran: land of the Aryans

-   invaded by Indo-European Aryans
-   Language:
    -   Farsi
        -   common language of Iran, spoken by most
        -   Indo-European language
        -   unlike Arabic or Aramaeic (both Semitic)
        -   51% speak Farsi as their first language
            -   an additional 8% speak Farsi dialects (mutually
                intelligble)

    -   26% speak a Turkic language (Azeri, Turkmen)
    -   7% Kurdish
    -   3% Arabic
    -   some Beluchi in the southeast
        -   some violent seperatist activity

-   in 1935 Reza Shah asked other countries to call the country Iran
    -   reflects Reza Shah's interest in pre-Islamic Iranian history
    -   also his attachment to Nazi Aryan ideology

-   Religion:
    -   Zoroastrianism was the religion of Iran before Islam
    -   Muslim world
        -   \~90% of the Muslim world is Sunni
            -   branches such as Sufi, Salafi etc.
            -   believe that Caliph does not have to be related to
                Muhammed
            -   Sunnis believe that the teachings of the Qu'ran are the
                *word* of God (through Archangel Gabriel to Muhammed)
                -   interpretation is settled

        -   \~10% Shi'ite
            -   branches such as Alawites etc.
            -   believe that only family of Muhammed can be the Caliph
            -   Shi'ite has an established clergy
                -   most members of the clergy have advanced (\~masters
                    degree) training
                -   position is dependent on academic reputation
                    (members or groups in the heirarchy are chosen by
                    existing members)

            -   encourages debate over interpretation (humans are not
                able to fully understand God's word, and as we progress,
                we can understand it better)
                -   still the *word* of God

        -   initially, this is not a theological, but political dispute,
            only later did it become theological

    -   In Iran
        -   9% Sunni
        -   90% Shi'ite
        -   other 1% made up of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Baha'i
            -   most Jews have left Iran
            -   Baha'i are the most persecuted

        -   until 2004 with the election of Iraq's government, it was
            the only country governed by Shi'ites
        -   Iran is a theocracy
            -   ruled by clerics who have studied the word of God
                -   clerics have a veto over all legislation and
                    candidates for office reviewed for conformism with
                    the Qu'ran

        -   Shari'a is the basis of law
            -   government will punish now, so that there are no
                violations of Shari'a (which will them and others to
                damnation)

    -   In Iran, the law is called the "Law of Retribution"
    -   Iran was Sunni until the 16th century when it turned Shi'ite
        -   Shi'ite Islam was taken on by the rulers of Iran for
            political reasons
            -   Enemies, the Turks and Arabs were Sunni

The Pahlavi Dynast
------------------

-   only two kings

I.  Reza Shah
    A.  Born Reza Khan -- mid-level military officer
        -   puts down an attempt to create a Soviet republic in
            northwestern Iran

    B.  With his 3,000 troops, Khan occupies Tehran (with the support of
        some local leaders) -- and becomes (with British backing) the
        power behind the throne of the last Qajar King
    C.  After four years, Khan overthrows the Qajar dynasty
        1.  Names himself shahinshah (king of kings)
        2.  Takes dynastic name Pahlavi

    D.  Reza Shah establishes a reformist and anti-clerical government
        that is also highly autocratic ("modernizing authoritarianism")
        -   modeled on Turkey under the New Turks
            -   authoritarian
            -   modernization
            -   transition away from Islam

        1.  Builds first railroads and factories
        2.  Expropriates land from rural elites
        3.  Forbids women from wearing veils and requires men to shave
            their beards
        4.  Closes religious schools and replaces them with state-run
            schools with curricula based on science

    E.  In 1941, the USSR and the UK occupied Iran. The Shah fled -- and
        died soon after in exile
        -   Shah sympathized with Hitler and Aryan ideology (Iran the
            original land of the Aryans)

    -   Allies concerned that Iran will provide Germany with oil

II. Muhammad Reza Shah Comes to Power
    A.  After the war, the UK and the USSR (eventually) leave Iran
    B.  Iran becomes a constitutional monarchy as provided by the
        Constitution of 1906
    C.  In 1949, the National Front (largely nationalistic coallition)
        wins the Majles (parliament) elections and form a series of
        governments
        1.  In 1951, the Majles votes to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian
            Oil Company (AIOC), which is 51% British (government) owned
            -   compensation offered

        2.  A month later, Muhammad Mosaddeq becomes Prime Minister
            -   orders all British employees of AIOC out of the county
                (concerned that British and Americans are plotting to
                overthrow him)
            -   Iran temporarily struggles with mining oil without
                sufficiently skilled workers

        3.  Mosaddeq, fearing the UK and the US are plotting against him
            (true), assumes extraoridinary powers and appeals to Tudeh
            (Communist party) for support
            -   Ties with the Communists (although neither Mosaddeq nor
                his party Communist) cause fear by the monarchy and the
                clergy

        4.  The CIA organizes a military coup in 1953; Mosaddeq is
            forced out of power.
            -   ends up being counter productive (raises anti-American
                sentiment in Iran)

    D.  At first the Shah is a figurehead for a military regime.
        Overtime the Shah assumes increasing amounts of power and
        becomes and absolute monarch
        -   clergy supports Shah in the 1950s

    E.  In January 1963, the Shah announces "the White Revolution" -- a
        series of reforms. These reforms have the result (not
        coincidentally) of centralizing power in the hands of the Shah
        -   designed to stop a "Red Revolution" by the communists
        -   advised by Kennedy administration who advised many dictators
            around the world to improve conditions for the people

        1.  Land is purchased from absentee land lords (living in the
            city) and seized from the clergy. Then the land is sold to
            landless peasants who borrow the purchase price of the land
            from the government (at low rates of interest)

        2.  The government supports farmers with fertilizers, damn and
            irrigation projects etc.

            -   Iran is depleting is ground water reserves at an
                unsustainable rate

        3.  Women given the vote (not significant in an autocracy) and
            the right to work outside the home withouth their husband's
            permission
        4.  The religious courts are abolished and replaced with secular
            courts; a secular Civil Code (based on European law
            (Napoleonic Code)) replaces Shari'a as the basis of Iranian
            law
        5.  A Literacy Corps is established to educated the rural
            population

    F.  The White Revolution earns the hostility of the clergy (and the
        Ayatollah Khomeini in particular)
    G.  Meanwhile, the Shah's regime had grown more repressive.
        1.  SAVAK est. in 1957

            -   equivalent of the KGB
            -   tortured and killed dissedents (including those living
                in other countries)

        2.  Constitutional rights were ignored; newspapers, political
            parties and NGOs opposed tot the centralization of power or
            to human rights issues were shut down

    3.  The Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors, town
        mayors, village headmen and election superviosors -- allowing
        Majales (parliamentary) elections

    H.  In March 1963, government troops raid a seminary in Qom, killing
        2.  Khomeini and 60 other clerics are aressed. Riotes ensue
            throughtout Iran; Shah declares martial law.

        -   clergy had been preaching against the regime

    -   remaining students flee to Khomeini's house
    -   Khomeini is expected to give a speech over the radio, before he
        does, all power in the city is shut off

    1.  Khomeini arrested again in Nov. 1964 and exiled to Iraq, when
        Saddam Hussein takes power, Khomeini flees to France

    I.  While Khomeini is in exile, a number of trends emerge that lead
        to the Revolution of 1979
        1.  The failure of land reform

        a.  Farms too small and dry to produce enough to allow farmers
            to repay government loans
        b.  When farmers lose land, they become bitter and move into the
            slmums of Iran's growing cities (Tehran doubles in size in
            the '70s) (Half of population urbanized by 1979)
            -   discontented poor become a politcal force in the cities

    2.  The Shah and his followers become increasingly corrupt
        a.  The Pahlavi Foundation (run by Empress) runs businesses in
            tourism, mining, manufacturing, insurance, banking etc.
            (most of the productive industries)

        b.  The Shah buys the loyalty of the military and other key
            supporters

        -   military is provided with the latest weapons
            -   small nuclear program (shut down by Khomeini)

        -   military children given ability to study abroad and
            comfortable jobs
        -   Shah distributes cash

    -   Not only does the Shah become out of touch with the people, but
        is also seen as a bad Muslim by taking on Western values of
        materialism

    3.  All secular opposition is shut down by the Shah; the only
        opposition to the Shah that remains is in the country's mosques
        and seminaries. Political Islam becomes the only basis of
        opposition to the Shah
        -   After 1963, critics of the Shah no longer favor a political
            solution based on the 1906 constitution; instead, they favor
            a new political system

III. In exile, Khomeini re-interprets and old Shi'ite religious doctrine
    velayat-e faqih ("guardianship of the religious jurist")
    -   idea that religious leader should supervise the government to
        make it did not do anything against the Qu'ran
    -   historically, it was interpreted to mean that the clergy should
        advise the government not being actively involved in politics
    -   1970 - publication of "Islamic Government"
        -   Khomeini takes the position that the religious scholars
            should run the country because they best know the word of
            God
        -   Religious scholars should have power to veto any legislation
            and review all political candidates
        -   not agreed with by most Islamic clerics

    -   1979 - Iran adopts a constitution based on Khomeini's
        interpretation of velayat-e faqih

The Iranian Revolution
----------------------

I.  In the late '70s, the Pahlavi Dynasty came under pressure
    A.  In 1977-78, prices rose 20% while oil revenues dropped
        1.  Shah cut construction projects
        2.  Shah blaimed "profiteers" for inflation -- earning him the
            resentment and fear of the bazaaris (bazaar merchants) (fear
            that the Shah will open department stores)

    B.  The Shah is under pressure from Western governments, newspapers
        and NGOs to liberalize the regime

    -   Carter adminstration puts emphasis on human rights

    C.  The Shah is dying of cancer -- wants a political settlement in
        place before he dies
        -   only known to the royal family

    -   son is only in his 20s and wants to assure his place

    D.  The Shah begins to liberalize Iran politically -- but
        liberalization soon escapes his control
        1.  Iranians from all walks of life call for an end to the
            monarchy

        2.  Iranian civil society groups quickly reform
            -   has been seen throughout Iranian history
            -   unites different political groups against the Shah
                (Liberal Democrats, Marxists, various Islamists)

II. The Revolution is fought in the streets of Tehran
    -   unlike other revolutions (Russian, Chinese, Mexican) which were
        fought as civil wars in the country

    A.  Bloody Friday (8 Sept. 1978) -- troops open fire on peaceful
        protestors, killing hundreds
    B.  A general stike paralyzes the country
        -   includes almost all business (oil, banks, bazaars etc.)

        1.  Local committees, organized by mosques (not on strike), and
            funded by bazaar merchants, provide food for the hungry
            people
        2.  Police begin to disappear from the streets of Tehran and are
            replaced by volunteer militias (pasdaran). The pasdaran
            become the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
            -   police fear that a revolutionary government will seek
                reprisal
            -   Revolutionary Guard remains extremely powerful today
                -   strongest opposition to dealings with the West

    C.  Demonstrations against the Shah attract millions; American
        politicians and newspapers call for the Shah to resign
        1.  Shah leaves Iran in Jan. 1979

    2.  Two weeks later, Khomeini returns from Paris

    D.  On the 11 Feb. 1979, guerillas and air force cadets seize the
        main army barracks, the police station, jails and broadcasting
        studios or Tehran -- and proclaim the victory of the Islamic
        Revolution
        -   broadcasting studios are key, clerics loyal to Khomeini
            control all broadcasting

III. April 1979, Iranian voters vote overwhelmingly to abolish the
    monarchy and replace it with an "Islamic Replubic"
    -   definition of "Islamic Republic" is unclear

    A.  Bazargan, Khomeini's first PM, had wnated to propsoe a
        "democratic Islamic Republic"
        -   struck down by Khomeini, saying that Islam was inherently
            democratic

    B.  Struggle for power among different factions takes place from
        4/79 to 6/81 -- thousands killed
        -   variety of Islamists, some are moderate (looking for
            something more like Turkey), though others are more radical
            following Khomeini
        -   many more killed in this struggle than in the Revolution
            (similar to French Revolution)

IV. A new constitution is drafted in 1979, drafted by the Assembly of
    Religious Experts
    A.  The Assembly is popularly elected (by universal suffrage,
        including women and non-Shi'ites) but the only people allowed to
        run are Shi'ite clerics
        1.  During the election, the state media are controlled by
            Khomeini's clerical allies (senior clerics)
        2.  Independent newspapers are banned
        3.  Khomeini's opponents (secularists and moderate Islamists)
            boycott the election
            -   done regularly, results in the most radical candidates
                being elected

        4.  Vigilante groups (hezbollah, "Party of God") intimidate
            voters

    B.  The constitution incorporates Khomeini's interpretation of
        veleyat-e faqih (and creates a system of clerical supervision of
        the government). It does create an elected Majles and an elected
        president
        1.  The Constitution thus rests on Shi'ite theology (as
            interpreted by Khomeini) and Western notions of popular
            sovereignty and checks-and-balances

    C.  PM Bazargan had wanted a constitution that created a
        presidential republic. When Bazargan proposes allowing the
        voters to consider his proposed constitution, the broadcasting
        media begins a campaign to discredit him
        -   Bazargan proposal based on the French Fifth Republic, with a
            strong president (had himself in mind)

    D.  When the Shah comes to the US for medical treatement, Khomeini
        accuses the US embassy in Tehran of plotting against the regime.
        A group of students seize the embassy, taking 50 Americans
        hostage. The students have Khomeini's support
        -   America takes the position that it will accept any
            government chosen by the people
        -   America initially refuses to allow the Shah into the US,
            though Carter is persuaded to allow him in by various
            powerful friends of the Shah
        -   accusations are believable, given that the US has done
            things in past (including in 1950s Iran)
        -   embassy had already been taken over a few weeks earlier,
            which ended when Khomeini demanded that they leave

    1.  when Bazargan tries to persuaded Khomeini to release the
        hostages, he is rebuffed, exposed as powerless, Bazargan resigns
        -   much international pressure to free the hostages

    2.  A month later, Iranian voters approve the new constitution
        -   Khomeini uses the threat of American attack to rally support

        a.  99% vote yes
        b.  But turnout is only 75%

V.  Iran's first president under the new constitution, Bani-Sadr, is
    elected in 1980. He wins 75% of the vote and enjoys Khomeini's
    support
    A.  Within 17 months, Bani-Sadr is impeached and exiled to France.
        His foreign minister is executed
        -   had been with Khomeini during Khomeini's exile in France,
            was believed to be closely tied to Khomeini until ousting

    B.  Thousands killed in the consolidation of the regions -- most are
        people who supported the Revolution and worked with the radical
        Islamists to topple the Shah
    C.  People from every political faction other then Khomeini's are
        purged from military and civil service
    D.  Religious minorities persecuted
        -   Sunnis
        -   little persecution
        -   no Sunni mosques have been allowed in Tehran

    1.  Christians and Zoroastrians suffer job discrimination
    2.  Jews are persecuted falsly as Israeli spies
    3.  Baha'i are executed

    E.  Trends/events that contribute to Khomeini's consolidation of
        power
        1.  The hostage crisis allows Khomeini to remove all political
            office holders who disagree with him

        -   Questions loyalty under the threat of American attack

    2.  Iraq attacks in 1980. Khomeini is able to encourage Iranians to
        rally around him
        -   8 year war
        -   \~1/2 million die on each side
        -   makes appeal to repel the "new Arab invasion"

    3.  The war with Iraq allows Khomeini to increase the level of
        repression directed against alleged threats

    -   kills and imprisons thousands

    4.  Oil prices rise after the Revolution; and the state has a lot
        more money to spend. Even though the country is at war, the
        government is able to spend a lot of money in provding the lives
        of the rural poor
        -   education
        -   electricity
        -   roads
        -   plumbing
        -   medical clinics
