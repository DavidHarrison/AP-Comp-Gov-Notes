The Structure of Iranian Government
===================================

(from handout)

- combines democratic and theocratic government
    - not a real democracy with political freedom

I.  **The Leader** is the most powerful person in the Iranian government
    -   should be the most knowledgeable in religious law
        -   true of Khomeini
        -   not so true of Khamenei

    A.  The Leader is elected by the Assembly of Religious Experts
        1.  The Assembly is an 86-member body elected every eight years
            -   elected by voters (universal suffrage)

        2.  The Assembly consists of (Shi'ite) clerics (male) (seminary
            master's degree required)
        3.  Candidates for the Assembly must be approved by the Leader
            and the Guardian Council
        4.  The Leader is elected for life, but the Assembly claims that
            it may remove the Leader for mental incapacity
            -   removal could cause a constitutional crisis

    B.  The Leader enjoys broad powers
        1.  The Leader must approve candidates for President
        2.  The Leader may dismiss an elected President
        3.  The Leader is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces
            a.  The Leader can mobilize the Armed Forces and declare war
            b.  The Leader can negotiate peace
            c.  The Leader can appoint and dismiss officers of the
                regular Armed Forces, the Revolutionary Guard and the
                police and Basij militia
            d.  The Leader selects the Minister of Defense

        4.  The Leader may nominate and remove the Chief Judge, the
            Chief Prosecutor and the Revolutionary tribunals, and may
            remove any judge from office

    C.  The Leader selects the 6 clerical members of the 12-member
        Guardian Council
        1.  The other six members of the Council are nominated by the
            Chief Judge (himself appointed by the Leader) and appointed
            by the Majlis

        -   When signed by the President (after passing by Majlis) the
            bill automatically goes to the Guardian Council, where it is
            reviewed twice (once for consistency with the Qu'ran, once
            for consistency with the Constitution)

        2.  The 6 members of the Guardian Council appointed by the
            Leader review all legislation approved by the Majlis to make
            certain it conforms with the Shari’a
        3.  All 12 members of the Guardian Council review all
            legislation approved by the Majlis to make certain it
            conforms with the Iranian Constitution
        4.  All 12 members of the Guardian Council must approve
            candidates for elective office, including candidates for
            President and the Majlis
            -   in each election, it has disqualified between 11% and
                40% of candidated

    D.  The Leader appoints the Expediency Council (which currently has
        32 members)
        -   Iranian government has a tendency to move slowly

        1.  The Expediency Council resolves differences between the
            Majlis and the Guardian Council
        2.  The Expediency Council can promulgate legislation
        3.  The Expediency Council is chaired by the Hojjat-al-Islam
            Hashemi Rafsanjani

    E.  The Leader also appoints
        1.  the preachers at major urban mosques
            -   politically loaded
                -   no Sunni mosques in Tehran

        2.  the director of the state broadcasting network
        3.  the heads of the major religious foundations (which control
            press outlets, business enterprises and industries, and
            which provide some social services)

    F.  There have been two Leaders under the 1979 Iranian Constitution
        1.  The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1979-1989)
        2.  The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (a Hojjat-al-Islam at the time of
            his election) (1989 to present)
            -   rumoured to be dying for the last 15 years

II. **The President plays** a significant role in national policymaking
    A.  The President is elected every four years by universal suffrage
        -   until 2009 people believed that they had at least a
            partially democratic system

        1.  Candidates for President must be pious Shi’ite Muslims
        2.  Candidates for President must be approved by the Leader and
            the Guardian Council
        3.  No person can be elected to more than two consecutive terms
            as President

    B.  The President has significant powers
        1.  The President prepares the annual budget and supervises
            economic matters
        2.  The President may propose legislation to the Majlis
        3.  The President must approve all treaties, laws and agreements
        4.  The President implements foreign and domestic policy, and
            chairs the National Security Council
        5.  The President appoints the Vice Presidents, cabinet
            ministers other than the Defense Minister (but must choose a
            cleric as the Minister of Intelligence), provincial
            governors and town mayors
            -   cabinet descisions have been overturned by the Leader

        6.  The President appoints the directors of some of the most
            important publicly owned enterprises (e.g., the National
            Iranian Oil Company, the National Electricity Board, the
            National Bank)
        -   can use influence to encourange/discourage eligibility Majlis

    C.  The President heads a bureaucracy consisting of 600,000 civil
        servants and 1.5 million employees
        1.  The key ministries are Culture and Islamic Guidance
            (behavior), Intelligence, Heavy Industries, and
            Reconstruction (infrastructure)
        2.  The clergy “monopolize” (Abrahamian) the Intelligence,
            Interior, Justice, and Culture and Islamic Guidance
            ministries, and control the other ministries through their
            relatives and protégés

    D.  With the exception of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the significant
        Presidents of the Islamic Republic have been clerics
        1.  Abolhassan Bani-Sadr (elected 1979; removed from office
            1980)
        2.  Mohammad Ali Rajai (succeeded to office 1980; assassinated
            1981)
        3.  The Hojjat-al-Islam Ali Khamenei (1981-1989)
        4.  The Hojjat-al-Islam Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997)
        5.  The Sayyid Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005)
        6.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013)
        7.  The Hojjat-al Islam Hassan Rouhani (2013 to present)

III. **The Majlis** plays an important role in policymaking
    A.  The Majlis has 290 members
        1.  The Majlis is elected every four years by universal suffrage
        2.  All candidates for the Majlis must be approved by the Leader
            and the Guardian Council

        -   members are frequently clerics (at some times more than 50%
            of the Majlis have been clerics)

    B.  Powers of the Majlis
        1.  The Majlis may enact or amend laws (subject to the approval
            of the President and the Guardian Council)
        2.  The Majlis must approve the government's budget, foreign
            loans, international treaties and cabinet appointments
        3.  The Majlis can remove members of the cabinet (and can
            impeach the President – but not the Leader – for misconduct)
        4.  The Majlis selects 6 of the members of the Guardian Council
            from a list of nominees drawn up by the Chief Judge
        5.  The Majlis may investigate cabinet members, affairs of state
            and complaints against the executive and the judiciary

IV. **The Judiciary** remains highly centralized, as it was under the
    Pahlavi Dynasty
    -   initially it was assumed that a appellate system would not be
        needed given that most public officials had been through
        seminary

    A.  The Shari’a is the basis of Iranian civil and penal law
        1.  In the Retribution Law enacted early in the Islamic
            Republic, the Shari' a was narrowly interpreted
            a.  The Law mandates the death penalty for adultery,
                homosexuality, apostasy (leaving Islam), drug
                trafficking and habitual drunkenness
                - often converted to prison terms
            b.  The Law establishes such punishments as stoning, live
                burial and amputation
                - also lashing
            c.  Women and men, and Muslims and non-Muslims, are treated
                differently under the Retribution Law

        2.  In practice, courts often do not implement the harsh
            penalties authorized by the Retribution Law but instead
            imprison criminals
            a.  Such crimes as consumption of alcohol (by Muslims),
                rowdy public behavior, breaking curfew and insulting the
                police are typically punished by public flogging
            b.  Pre-marital sexual relations are punished by both
                flogging and imprisonment

    B.  The state retains control over the judicial system
        1.  The courts are hierarchically organized in an appellate
            system
        2.  The central government retains the power to appoint judges;
            the Leader has the power to dismiss any judge\
