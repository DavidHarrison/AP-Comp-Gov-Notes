Recent Iranian Political History
================================

(from handout)

I.  Elections to the Majlis
    A.  All candidates must be over 30, under 75; first-time candidates
        must be university graduates
        -   raises some class issues

        1.  All candidates must have a “belief in and commitment in
            practice to Islam and the sacred system of the Islamic
            Republic of Iran” but 5 seats (out of 290) set aside for
            Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians
        2.  All candidates must be approved by Guardian Council\
             1992: GC keeps 1/3 of candidates off ballot\
             1996: GC keeps 44% of candidates off ballot\
             2000: GC keeps only 11% of candidates off ballot (including
            only a few prominent reformers)\
             2004: GC keeps 35% of candidates off ballot, including 80
            sitting members of Majlis; reformist members of Majlis
            resign in protest and call boycott of elections. Turnout
            falls to 51% (28% in Tehran), but conservatives win a
            landslide victory.\
             2008: Executive Councils appointed by regional governors
            (appointed by Pres. Ahmadinejad) keep 1/3 of candidates (70%
            of reformist candidates) off ballot; some are actually
            reinstated by the GC.

    B.  All elections are held on a non-partisan basis.
        1.  Official campaign is a week long; posters are forbidden;
            campaign literature cannot be bigger than \~ 4” x 6”
        2.  Candidates list the politicians and colleagues they support

    C.  Voting system rewards groupings that win pluralities, magnifying
        pluralities into sizeable majorities
        1.  Country divided into 28 Majlis constituencies; each
            constituency allocated seats on the basis of its population
        2.  Voting takes place in two rounds Any candidate who wins more
            than 25% of votes in first round is elected second round
            held several months later; number of candidates on ballot
            limited to twice the number of seats remaining to be filled;
            candidates are the highest placing candidates not elected in
            first round
            -   amplifies pluralities

II. Elections for the First Majlis (1980)
    A.  Elections open: 4400 candidates, 40 political parties; 200
        daily/weekly papers
    B.  Three major groupings contest elections
        1.  Islamic Republican Party – est. by Khomeini supporters,
            favors establishment of an Islamic Republic under the
            supervision of a clerical guardian
        2.  Mehdi Bazargan’s Liberation Movement and the National Front
            – favor free markets, limited government, liberal democracy
            and good relations with US. The Liberation Movement
            supported a consultative role for the clergy; the National
            Front favored a secular state.
        3.  The left, splintered among Islamic (but anti-clerical)
            groups (e.g., the Mojahedin), secular groups (e.g., the
            Fedayin, Tudeh) and supporters of Bani-Sadr (the Islamic
            Republic’s first president).

    C.  The IRP rigged some of the first-round elections; the second
        round elections were postponed indefinitely. When the second
        round elections were finally held, Bani-Sadr had been forced
        into exile, many political parties had been banned, and the
        Mojahedin, Fedayin and Tudeh had been “eliminated. (25,000
        political prisoners executed).
        1.  IRP wins 35% of vote and 60% of seats
        2.  The Mojahedin win 25% of votes and no seats

III. Elections for the Second Majlis (1984)
    A.  The opposition is banned. The IRP controls the media, the civil
        service, the religious foundations and the mosques. The country
        is at war.

    -   Clergy controls the media

    B.  The IRP wins a landslide victory (but turnout falls from 80%
        (very high) in the first round of the 1980 election to 60%). 54%
        of Majles deputies elected are clerics.
        -   "rally round the flag" effect due to the war

IV. Elections for the Third Majlis (1988)
    A.  Khomeini dissolves the IRP in 1987 due to in-fighting over
        economic policy. He allows two competing organizations, as long
        as they support Islam, the Islamic Republic and Khomeini’s view
        of velayat-e faqih
        1.  Assoc. of Militant Clergy (Jam’eh) – free marketers who
            support laissez-faire economic policies, low taxes, minimal
            gov’t. regulation of business and a balanced budget
        2.  Society of Militant Clergy (Majmu’eh) – statists who support
            government management of the economy, redistributive
            policies, and establishment of a welfare state

    B.  The Majmu’eh win the 1988 elections, but are unable to maintain
        significant influence
        1.  Khomeini dies in 1989; replaced by the more economically
            laissez-faire Ali Khamenei
        2.  Hashemi Rafsanjani becomes president in 1989. Rafsanjani, a
            pragmatic moderate, begins to liberalize the economy at the
            end of the war with Iraq, in response to the economic crisis
            that accompanies the 1980s decline in oil prices
            a.  cuts state expenditures
            b.  encourages more private investment

    C.  Khamenei gives control of two leading newspapers to supporters
        of laissez-faire economics

V.  Elections for the Fourth Majlis (1992)
    A.  The GC limits election campigns to one week and threatens to
        purge Majlis members with “difficult attitudes.” 75 Majlis
        candidates withdraw; 40 more are disqualified (inc. a prominent
        judge and an Ayatollah).
    B.  Voter turnout drops (less than 55% in Tehran), and the economic
        liberals win easily. The Majmu’eh suspend activities; some begin
        to question the power of the GC and the fact that the Leader is
        not popularly elected.
    C.  The supporters of Leader Khamenei and President Rafsanjani begin
        to split.
        1.  Both Khamenei and Rafsanjani support decontrol of prices,
            ending rationing, trade liberalization, and ending land
            reform and income redistribution.
        2.  Khamenei and his supporters favor continued state control of
            the media, a purge of liberal intellectuals from Iran’s
            universities and continued conservative standards of dress
            for women.
        3.  Rafsanjani’s supporters in the Majlis (a minority) favor
            cultural liberalization and further economic reform,
            including:
            a.  opening up the economy to FDI (from MNCs and emigrants)
            b.  eliminating privileged access of religious foundations
                to capital, goods
            c.  cutting state subsidies and raising non-oil taxes
                -   distorts peoples behavior to waste artificially
                    cheap goods

            d.  further privatization

        4.  Rafsanjani cannot get his program of cultural and further
            economic liberalization through the Majlis
            a.  Restrictions on foreign bus ownership not liberalized
                until 2002
            b.  Religious foundations retained privileges
            c.  State subsidies not cut; sales and bus. taxes not raised
            d.  Very little further privatization

        -   after protest of 2009 election protest crackdown, Rafsanjani
            is removed from the Assembly of Religious Experts, though
            stays on as head of the Expediency Council

VI. Elections for the Fifth Majlis (1996)
    A.  Rafsanjani starts a new political organization to run
        candidates, but conservatives backed by Khamenei win the
        elections
        1.  The mayor of Tehran, a prominent supporter of the
            organization, imprisoned for alleged embezzlement at height
            of campaign
        2.  Pro-Rafsanjani press shut down

    B.  Upset victory of Mohammad Khatami in the 1997 presidential
        election reorders the political landscape
    C.  1999: Chief Judge (appointed by Khamenei) shuts down reformist
        newspaper; students demonstrate; Revolutionary Guard occupies
        campuses, kills students

VII. Elections for the Sixth Majlis (2000) and the Failure of Reform
    Efforts
    A.  Khatami’s Second of Khordad movement (an alliance of liberal
        groups) won the 2000 Majlis elections
        1.  The movement is originally pro-regime but begins to militate
            for relaxed press restrictions and fewer privileges for the
            clergy
        2.  Movement supported by prominent intellectuals and
            journalists
        3.  80% of vote goes to reformists on 70% turnout (turnout for
            previous national election – to the Assembly of Religious
            Experts – was 46%)

    B.  The Majlis adopts a number of reforms
        1.  Testimony of men and women, and Muslims and non-Muslims, to
            be given equal weight in court
        2.  Divorce courts must divide property equally between husbands
            and wives
        3.  Women, like men, to be offered scholarships to study abroad
            (at government expense)
        4.  Private banking permitted
        5.  Some state-owned enterprises privatized
        6.  Privileges of clergy and religious foundations reduced
        7.  Liberalization of restrictions on FDI
        8.  Intelligence Ministry purged
        9.  Prison conditions investigated
        10. Criminal procedure (rights of the accused) reformed

    C.  The Leader and the GC respond by
        1.  Vetoing most of the legislation as inconsistent with Shari’a
            and the constitution (mostly the social and political
            changes, economic changes pass)
        2.  Closing down more than 50 pro-reform newspapers and
            prosecuting journalists

    D.  2002 – Students demonstrate when death sentence given to
        professor for “insulting Islam”

VIII. Elections for the Seventh Majlis (2004)
    A.  The GC bars 3500+ candidates from running, including 87 reform
        deputies
        1.  40 other Majlis deputies resign in protest and call for an
            election boycott
        2.  Voter turnout falls to 51% (28% in Tehran)

    B.  Conservatives win easily. They are also helped by the presence
        of US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Bush’s “Axis of Evil”
        speech, seen as threatening Iran
        -   younger generation had been sympathetic to the US following
            9/11
        -   Iran opposes the Taliban, who are anti-Shi'ite
            -   mistreatment of Shi'ite Hazara by Taliban
        -   In 2002, Khatami had proposed opening talks with US; Bush
            declines

    C.  2005 Presidential Elections
        1.  Rafsanjani (now 70) runs against Ahmadinejad (a 49 year-old
            Engineering lecturer who had been appointed Mayor of
            Tehran). The result (62% for Ahmadinejad to 36% for
            Rafsanjani) is an upset and a landslide
        2.  Factors leading to Ahmadinejad’s victory
            a.  Many reform supporters boycott the elections to protest
                the fact that some more progressive candidates were not
                allowed to run
            b.  Ahmadinejad campaigns as an economic populist who wants
                to use increasing oil revenues to provide services to
                Iran’s urban poor and rural population
            c.  Rafsanjani has a reputation for corruption
            d.  Ahmadinejad was openly supported by leaders of the
                Revolutionary Guard and the Basij militias, in violation
                of Iranian law
            e.  American saber-rattling: the invasion of Iraq, the calls
                for regime change, the insistence that Iran’s nuclear
                program be dismantled, the “Axis of Evil” speech

    D.  Rafsanjani wins a striking comeback victory in the 2006 Assembly
        of Religious Experts election, becoming the Speaker of the
        Assembly. Clerics close to Ahmadinejad are badly defeated.

IXIV. Elections for the Eighth Majlis (2008)
    A.  Executive Councils appointed by provincial governors (in turn
        appointed by Ahmadinejad) disqualify 1/3 of candidates
        (including 70% of the reformist candidates and 80 sitting Majlis
        deputies)
    B.  After the elections (held 14 March 2008), there are four
        factions in the Majlis
        1.  Reformists (number increases from 30 to 50 deputies)
        2.  Ahmadinejad supporters
        3.  Supporters of Ali Larijani (former nuclear arms negotiator
            with West; now Speaker of the Majlis)
        4.  Supporters of Mohammad Qalibaf (the “green,” conservative
            Mayor of Tehran)

X.  The Presidential Elections of 2009 and the Ensuing Political Crisis
    A.  Presidential campaign unlike any in the history of the Islamic
        Republic, featuring live, televised presidential debates, huge
        mass rallies, an unusual level of criticism of Iran's political
        leaders and an unusual lack of civility (given that all four of
        the candidates had held positions in the regime). Khamenei
        breaks with precedent and endorses Ahmadinejad’s reelection.
    B.  12 hours after polls close (in a country that hand-counts paper
        ballots), the Interior Ministry announces an overwhelming
        electoral victory for Ahmadinejad, over his nearest rival,
        "reformist" candidate (and former Prime Minister) Mir Hossein
        Mousavi.
    C.  All three defeated candidates (including one conservative)
        refuse to accept these results, calling them fraudulent. Massive
        street protests in Iranian cities ensue. Iranian demonstrators
        use social networking internet sites to circumvent restrictions
        on Iranian and foreign press coverage of the protests.
        -   Western reporters are confined to their hotel room,
            protestors film demonstrations
        -   protests are targeted at a Western audience (signs in
            English)

    D.  Khamenei intervenes in the controversy by publicly endorsing the
        election results, even before the Guardian Council recounts a
        sample of the ballots and announces its approval of the election
        results.
        -   tranforms the protests from being against the election to
            also being about Khamenei's authority

    E.  The Revolutionary Guard and the Basij militias use force to end
        the protests, resulting in the deaths of a number of
        demonstrators, and the arrest of scores of supporters of the
        demonstrators, many of them prominent members of Iran's
        political elite. Rafsanjani and Khatami publicly criticize the
        use of force against the demonstrators, and their torture and
        murder in prison after they are arrested.
    F.  Ahmadinejad purges Intelligence Ministry officials opposed to
        the crackdown on post-election demonstrators, prosecutes more
        than 100 people who supported the demonstrations in a show trial
        (complete with a “confession” from a former Vice President), and
        threatens to arrest those who question the legitimacy of his
        election (widely understood to mean his election opponents,
        Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, as well as Khatami and Rafsanjani).
        Karroubi is later threatened with prosecution and execution when
        he charges that both male and female demonstrators were raped in
        prison.
        -   Mousavi and Karroubi have been under house arrest since 2009
        -   Rafsanjani accepts the results, though criticizes use of
            force, he is forced to step down as the leader of Religious
            Experts

    G.  The Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri criticizes the regime as
        un-Islamic, terming its methods “Stalinist”. Following his death
        of natural causes in December 2009, his funeral (in Qom) becomes
        a massive anti-government rally.
    H.  Renewed protests late in December 2009 result in the deaths of
        an unknown number of protesters, including Ali Habibi-Mousavi,
        the nephew of Mir-Hossein Mousavi. The protests also spark
        sizable demonstrations in support of the Iranian regime as well
        as mass arrests of regime opponents. For the first time, Iranian
        authorities refer to the opposition as "enemies of God" (a
        criticism that can be used to justify their execution). Those
        accused of being "enemies of God" include at least one
        Ayatollah.
    I.  Attempts by the Iranian opposition to stage protests in February
        2010 are thwarted by sizable security operations; in much of the
        country, telephone, SMS message and internet services are
        blocked. Prominent members of the opposition are attacked
        (Khatami), arrested (Khatami’s brother and sister-in-law) or
        beaten (Karroubi, Mousavi’s wife) on their way to opposition
        rallies.
    J.  By March 2010, the violent suppression of mass protests by the
        Basij militia and the Revolutionary Guard, the arrest of
        thousands of demonstrators, the condemnation to death of a
        number of demonstration organizers and the execution of some of
        those sentenced to death have fatally weakened the opposition.
        Rafsanjani, who tilted towards the protesters following the
        election, makes clear his support for the Islamic regime (though
        not for Ahmadinejad).
    K.  The crackdown on opposition to the regime continues in the
        spring of 2010 with the banning of two political parties, the
        shuttering of a reformist newspaper and the sentencing of three
        opposition politicians to lengthy jail terms. In late 2010, the
        Iranian government seizes control of Iran’s largest private
        university and announces new restrictions, applicable to all
        universities, on instruction in twelve academic disciplines. The
        Iranian government also increases press censorship, sentences
        human rights lawyers and film directors to lengthy prison terms
        and begins a new crackdown on “immoral behavior.” In October
        2011, a university student is lashed 74 times for insulting
        Ahmadinejad (and given a 6 month prison sentence).

    -   Starting under Khamenei, Iran began to enrich uranium beyond
        what is necessary for power plants
        -   Under the Shah, the government had a nuclear research
            program
        -   Khomeini had declare nuclear weapons un-Islamic, and shut
            down the program

    L.  In January 2011, the Iranian government begins to phase out
        price subsidies on flour, cooking oil, gasoline, natural gas and
        electricity that consume nearly 10% of Iran’s GDP. The funds
        saved are to be spent on cash transfers to the poor and on
        infrastructure spending; Ahmadinejad claims that the poorest 60%
        of the population will be better off under the new system of
        market prices and cash transfers than they were with price
        subsidies. Concerns about rampant inflation (Iran’s official
        rate of inflation reaches 25% in 2012 due largely to the
        tightening of international sanctions) force a delay in
        implementation of the second round of subsidy cuts (from March
        2012 to at least March 2013).
        -   cash transfers are put on an honor system, 70% of the
            population signs up
        -   the majority of the loss is felt by the middle class

    M.  In March 2011, Rafsanjani is removed as the Chairman of the
        Assembly of Religious Experts. Meanwhile, the Majlis suspends
        debate on a bill that would place all Iranian NGOs under the
        supervision of an Interior Ministry committee.
    N.  In May 2011, the long-rumored rift between Ahmadinejad and
        Khamenei becomes public when Khamenei countermands Ahmadinejad's
        dismissal of Iran's Intelligence Minister. (Intelligence
        Ministry and Revolutionary Guard spies had bugged the office of
        Ahmadinejad’s Chief of Staff). The rift leads to the arrest in
        2011, on various charges, of more than 25 key Ahmadinejad
        supporters. (Ahmadinejad’s press advisor, for example, is
        sentenced to a year in prison for publishing an article
        questioning the country’s mandatory dress code for women and for
        insulting Khamenei on his website. Ahmadinejad is further
        humiliated when he is denied permission to visit the press
        advisor in prison).
        -   **common theme to arrest those around a prominent figure,
            but not the person themselves**

    O.  In 2011, the Iranian state media reports that \$ 2.6 billion has
        been embezzled from Iranian banks by corrupt bank executives.
        Eventually, 39 former bank executives are convicted of fraud;
        four are sentenced to death. The case draws Iran’s privatization
        drive into question (though the cases involve both state- owned
        and privately-owned banks); at one point, the scandal threatens
        to ensnare Ahmadinejad’s Chief of Staff.

XI. Elections for the Ninth Majlis (2012)
    A.  The Interior Ministry removes 17% of the candidates from the
        ballot, including 32 sitting Majlis members. While the
        proportion of disqualified candidates is lower than in 2004 and
        2008, there is a sharp drop in the number of (reformist)
        Iranians presenting themselves as candidates.
    B.  The election is largely boycotted by Iran’s opposition, though
        the official first round turnout rate is 64%. Conservatives
        loyal to Khamenei handily defeat conservatives loyal to
        Ahmadinejad; reformists win 75 seats.
        -   common, though generally leads to the situation worsening

    C.  In February 2013, one of the daughters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi is
        jailed. In May 2013, the Guardian Council disqualifies former
        president Rafsanjani from running for president in June.
    D.  In June 2013, the Hojjat-al-Islam Hassan Rouhani wins a surprise
        victory in the first round of Iran’s presidential election. A
        pragmatic conservative who once served as Iran’s chief
        negotiator with the West over the country’s nuclear program,
        Rouhani is nonetheless the most moderate candidate permitted to
        run for president; he succeeds by winning votes from reformists
