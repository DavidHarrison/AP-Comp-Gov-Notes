- In Shi'ite tradition, there were 12 Imams who carried on teachings (persecuted by the Sunni majority)
- 12th Imam never died, went into occlusion, will come back at the end of days when the Messiah comes
- no person has a real right to rule until the Messiah comes
- historically, the clergy has been disinterested in politics for this reason
- under Khomeini, the clergy takes the stance that it must become active in politics to prevent the Shah from secularizing Iran
