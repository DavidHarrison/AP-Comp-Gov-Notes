United States Government
========================

Essential Features
------------------

I.  American Exceptionalism
    -   cannot be compared
    -   implicitly, US sets standard
    -   Puritan city on a hill (can be seen by all)
    -   fighting for democracy
    -   not considered true by comparitivists
    -   less government than most developed countries, but the
        institutions still exist
    -   exceptionalism exists to an extent in most countries

II. Constitutionalism

    A.  Government may only exercise its powers in legally authorised
        ways, if not, laws are null and void
        -   exact wording is taken very seriously
        -   British "constitution" is not a single absolute document, it
            can be overturned by Parliament (eg Terrorism Act)

    B.  Judicial Review: courts will not enforce laws that violate the
        constitution
        -   little judicial review in Britain, can be overturned by
            parliament

III. Federalism

    -   sovereignty is divided between central and local governments,
        balance cannot be changed without state agreement
        -   Scottish parliament could be abolished/overridden by British
            parliament

    A.  Federal government's power is mostly limited to foreign affairs
        and regulating interstate commerce
        -   US government can now (since 1937) regulate anything with a
            national market

        -   Congressional powers are enumerated
            -   originally 17 - anything they need to do the 17 (18
                total)
            -   powers have grown over time (eg 13-15th ammendments
                (14th limits states (states could previously violate
                Bill of Rights (state churches)))
            -   Periods of growth include New Deal & Bush administration

    B.  In areas where congress is authorized to pass laws, its laws are
        **supreme**

    C.  General regulation of public health and safety (police powers)
        are left to the states

IV. Seperation of Powers (government divided into seperately selected
    legislative, executive and judicial branches)
    -   in Britain there is no seperation of powers (PM & Cabinet
        Ministers are MPs)
    -   Lame Duck causes slow passage of laws
    -   Two houses of Congress further divide house
    -   **Prevents any one person or group from becoming to powerful
        (simillarly to Federalism)**
    -   All States have their own division (only Nebraska does not have
        2 houses of leg.)

V.  Checks and Balances (each branch of government has some ability to
    block the acts of the other two)

VI. Conclusions/Observations

    A.  American government slow and innefficient by design

    B.  American government allows multiple access points for
        participation by well-organized groups; powerful interest groups
        characterize American government (background checks on guns
        supported by 90% of public, opposed by NRA)

    C.  The President's formal powers are quite limited
        -   Presidents gain power in crises (Lincoln, FDR)

    D.  The structure of US government makes "divided government"
        possible (if not normal)
        -   voters split tickets to keep parties in line

    E.  American political parties are weak and disunited
        1.  Size, diversity of the country
        2.  Electoral system creates two political parties, primaries
            give voters the power to nominate candidates (Duverger's
            Law)
        3.  American parties are amalgums of special intersts. They are
            not disciplined parties united by principle (\~3 Republican
            parties: business interests, tea party, social
            conservatives)
        4.  Well organized interest groups organized around one issue or
            set of related issues tend to be more effective than parties

    F.  Limited government intervention in a market based privately
        owned economy
        1.  Limited public ownership of enterprises
        2.  Moderate regulation of business, limited government planning
        3.  Government economic policy forcuses on short-term employment
            an inflation (Solyndra was out subsidized by the Chinese)
