Electoral Systems
=================

I.  Elections by Plurality in Single Member Districts (SMDs), "First
    Past the Post" (FPTP)
    -   District represents one representative
    -   by plurality (no absolute majority needed)
    -   US has 435 districts of \~ same pop.
        -   except in CA and LA by plurality

    A. Used in UK, US, Canada, Nigeria - tends to be used in countries
    with ties to the UK

    B. Duverger's Law: Generally results in a two-party system

II. Elections by Proportional Representation (PR)

    A.  Used in the Netherlands, Italy, Israel and Russia

    B.  PR systems usually have threshold requirements
        -   Germany set threshold to keep out neo-Nazis and Communists
        -   During Weimar threshold was \~1-2%, which made unstable
            governments
        -   When Russia increased the threshold from 4 to 7%, liberal
            parties dissappeared

    C.  Entire country or a sub-unit of the country may constitute a
        multi-member district
        -   entire country: Israel, Russia
        -   sub-unit: Germany

    D.  Duverger's Law: tends to produce a multi-party system and (in
        parliamentry systems) coallition governments

            Less Pow erful More Pow   erful (necessary majority for PM)

Bicameral Legislatures: two houses
----------------------------------

-   US unusual in that both must pass legislation
-   In countries not affected by US, upper house is weak (UK House of
    Lords)
-   In countries affected by US, upper house has similar power (Latin
    America, Germany, Japan, Nigeria)

Multi-Party Systems/Coalition Governments
-----------------------------------------

1.  Sometimes there is bagaining among parties even before election
2.  More often there are negotiations on government policy after the
    elections. The agreements reached on policies to be followed an on
    which parties will run which ministries, are put in a written
    coalition agreement

-   coalitions in the US are formed ad-hoc over each issue
