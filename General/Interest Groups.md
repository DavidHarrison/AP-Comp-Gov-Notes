Interest Groups
===============

In Western democracies, autonomous interest groups and political parties
play key roles (Structural Functionalism): - interest aggregation -
putting demands made on the political system by individuals of similar
opinion into group interests - make demands on the system - eg Sierra
Club, NRA - political parties do this over many issues (not single
intrest group) - general policies - Democratic Party: socially liberal,
more socialized - Republican Party: socially conservatice, less
socialized - interest articulation
