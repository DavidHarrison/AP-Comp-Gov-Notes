In which country (US/UK) does the judicial system of the country best reflect democratic values?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   define democractic values/democracy
-   argument to be made on both sides
-   does not matter which side is supported
-   evidence is what matters (seeing both sides)
-   Examples:
    -   Americans see the power of the courts to overrule legislation as
        democratic
        -   protects individual rights
        -   bad experiences with accountability by public opinion

    -   British see the 9 supreme court judges and non democratic
        -   not representative (old white males)
        -   appointed for life (not accountable)
        -   have the power to overrule a representative democratic
            institution
        -   public opinion holds politicians accountable

    -   Majority rules vs. individual rights
    -   provide historical examples (Native Americans, slavery, Jim Crow
        etc.)

Should the US become a parliamentry democracy
---------------------------------------------

-   Big trade offs
-   Do not care what the answer is, just see the trade offs
-   Tried to keep judicial review out (limit scope for a 30 minute
    question)
-   Trade offs:
    -   Pro:
        -   British government much faster (gay mariage quickly passed
            when public opinion shifted)
        -   British government can easily pass a budget each year
        -   American government struggles to pass budget

    -   Con:
        -   Can move too quickly (flip-flop)
        -   America rarely swings on national policy (requires consensus
            to make a descision)
        -   Lose checks and balances (core to the US system)
        -   PM has massive power (not particularly Cameron)
        -   Coalition can check/slow the PM

-   Thatcher did much more than Reagan (similar ideologies) because of
    the difference in systems
-   Proportional representation - more than two big parties - coalition
    government - no all powerful PM
-   Even with a big win (by German standards), Merkel must still
    negotiate a coalition (can force parties to compete for coalition)
-   Civil liberties are not necessarily much stronger in the US
-   Britain - more majority rule (not immeadiately, within a few years)

Why did the Blair governement devolve power and how does it differ from federalism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Unlike the others, it has a right answer
-   Difficult to get a very low grade, but difficult to get a high grade
-   Safer
-   More questions like this on the next test

Outline for Constitutional Question
-----------------------------------

-   Thesis: The United States should adopt a parliamentry system
    -   The advantages of efficiency would be greater than the
        disadvantages of reducing checks and balances

I.  British government is more efficient

    A.  Brown's stimulus; Cameron's austerity

    B.  Delay in stimulus package by Republicans; no austerity at all -
        all cuts are short term (does not deal with entitlements)

II. US speration of powers; checks and balances

    A.  Roosevelt had to constantly fight during New Deal despite large
        majority, Obama similar

    B.  British PM is powerful, but checks are adequate
        -   Thatcher forced out
        -   Tony Blair forced to only run for partial second term

        -   Supreme court will continue to exist
            -   Like Canada
            -   Proportional representation may check power

III. In conclusion, US can become faster with minimal expense to
    liberty.

Which is More Democratic
------------------------

-   American system anti-majoritarian
-   British - majoritarian, more potential for abuse
-   Both have been good, not perfect
-   Limit analysis to last 50-60 years
-   Liberties in US may be overstated
