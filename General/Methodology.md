Methodology
===========

I.  Comparing countries to each other at one time (snapshot)
    (quantitative comparisons, correlation (sources may be biased)
    (correlation does not imply causation))\
     vs.\
     Comparing developments in countries over time (video) (difficulty
    quantitizing)

II. Large-Scale Statistical Studies
    -   highly funded in 1960s and 70s vs.\
         Case Studies
    -   revolutions often studied
    -   look for patterns

III. Levels of Theory: how much is trying to be explained

    A.  Covering Laws: universal laws explaining political behaviours
        (eg rational consumer assumption)
        -   Duverger's Law: systems like the US, California, UK will for
            two party systems\\
            -   Definition: System with election by plurality in single
                member districts will form a 2 party system\\
            -   Congress requires only plurality (first past the post
                (fptp))\\
            -   (UK has 2$\frac{1}{2}$ parties: Lib Dems are a protest
                party)\\
            -   eg 2000 Florida election\\
            -   Proportional representation (PR): practiced in Israel,
                Germany, Netherlands\\
            -   elections by PR will result in a multi-party system

    B.  Structural-Functionalism (Almond)
        -   ten basic things done
        -   Ex: Political socialization (values of the system are passed
            on to young people)
        -   identify structures that fulfill the same function in
            different countries (Boy Scouts vs. Chinese Pioneers)
        -   develop hypotheses about the kinds of structures that will
            evolve in particular circumstances

    C.  Factor Analysis
        -   identify factors that lead to particular outcomes (eg
            religion, culture, economics)
        -   case study heavy

        -   most modern political science is done in
            Structural-Functionalism and Factor Analysis

    D.  Thick Description (Geertz)
        -   identify the factors that explain outcomes in terms of their
            subjective and symbollic meaning to participants
        -   thinking about personal motivations (eg explanation of
            Nazism through lost generation being filled in for by Nazis)
