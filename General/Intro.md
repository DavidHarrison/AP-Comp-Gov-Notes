Introduction to Comparitive Government
======================================

-   Social Science follows principes of hard science through observation
    and testing of ideas both qualitative and quantitative
-   Political behaviour limits its study because of the lack of control
    in the environment and lack of repeatability
-   Economics assumes rational behaviour
-   Economic Data
    -   Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total value of all goods and
        services in a country (final sales so as no to double count)
        -   US has the highest GDP at \~\$15 trillion
            -   China second (1.3 billion people)
            -   Japan third (127 million people)
            -   Germany fourth

    -   GDP per Capita
        -   divide GDP by population
        -   gives an idea of standard of living
        -   US GDP per capita was \$47,284 in 2010
            -   median income for family of four \~\$50,000
            -   government expenditure \~20% of economy
            -   business investment \~10% of economy

        -   Norway high on GDP per capita (oil revenue)
        -   China GDP per capita was \$4,382 in 2010
        -   Mexico GDP per capita was \$9566 in 2010

    -   GDP per Capita Adjusted
        -   income is not equally divided
        -   "Big Mac Scale" adjusts for PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) is
            GDP per capita adjusted
        -   China adjusted GDP per capita 2010 \$7519
        -   Mexico adjusted per capita GDP 2010 \$14,430 (growing)
        -   Low GDP per capita adjusted can put pressure for political
            change
