Writing a Timed Essay
=====================

-   Do not start writing immeadiately
-   Make sure to follow the prompt and stay relevant\
     thesis answers the question\
     (Will Russia have a democracy in 15 years? -/\> Stalinism)
-   Outline so as not to forget anything
-   Spend a few (5) minutes organizing/outlining
-   Introduction
    -   30 min not time for elegant intro
    -   very to the point/barebones
    -   Functions
        -   Thesis statement (early)
        -   Define terms in use if ambiguous (democratizing - no,
            globalization - yes)
        -   Signpost (three aspects of ... - three paragraphs)

-   Argument
    -   2-4 major arguments
    -   French style:
        -   paragraphs 2-3 support thesis
        -   paragraph 4 adresses counter-arguments:
        -   paragraph 5 conclusion

    -   Support arguments with *specific* factual details
    -   Difference between (A/B)/(3/5) is factual details
    -   Not studying after semester looses specifics
    -   Consider key counter-arguments and refute them

Example
-------

-   Thesis: globalization promotes democratization in newly
    industrialized countries (newly-industrialized - middling countries
    such as those of East Asia and S. America)
    -   thesis can be rewritten to reduce need for definitions

-   Define globalization
-   Signpost
    -   Economic
    -   Political
    -   Cultural

-   Globalization has three main points: economic, political and
    cultural
    -   DO NOT be elegant, witty, clever: stick to being
        factual/informative

### Economic Globalization

-   What:
    -   less trade barriers; more international trade (not
        irreversible)\
         (imperialization: goods from colony to manufacturing center to
        market in colony\
         modern: manufacture in poorer)
    -   Flow of capital: Forein direct investment (FDI)
    -   Foreign countries do business with developing countries (most of
        oil work in Nigeria by Shell)\
         Mulinational coporations (MNCs)

-   Promotes Democracy:
    -   increased GDP per capita
    -   lower poverty rates
    -   creation of educated middle class that demands democracy\
         (counter example: Japan, controlled by US army, land reform,
        income equality\
         Germany not during industrialization required foreign
        intervention)

-   Doesn't Promote Democracy:
    -   Industrialization promotes wage inequality
    -   Increased power of businesses to control the government
    -   MNCs erode sovereignty, forces competition between
        industrializing (poor) countries to fight down regulations
    -   Debt of gratitude of middle class to authoritarian government,
        insecurity in position

-   Cultural:
    -   Internet
    -   Want to live like America
    -   Don't necessarily want values or government of America
