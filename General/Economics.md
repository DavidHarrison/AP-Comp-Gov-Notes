Economics
=========

-   Capitalism does not imply a free market economy
-   Socialism does not imply a government planned economy Capitalism:
    Productive assets of the society are owned by private individuals or
    by corporations owned by private individuals
    -   no society is entirely capitalist (eg public education, postal
        service, utilities, transit) Socialism: Productive assets of the
        society are owned by "socially" (ie by the government)
    -   can be entirely srun by the government (eg Soviet USSR)
    -   partially owned by government (eg Britain 1945 - 1979, Sweden
        1930s - 1990s, Modern Norway)
    -   Cooperatives (run by workers) (eg Yugoslavia late 1940s - 1970s)
    -   Trade Unionism (eg Israel 80% of workers in unions, all unions
        belong to umbrella organization 1940s - 1970s)
    -   Customer ownership (eg REI)
    -   Mix (eg water in Norway)

-   no pure economies (public sector in US, black market in N. Korea)
    Arguments in support of capitalism
    -   more efficient than socialism
        -   confusion between capitalism implying a free market economy,
            and socialism a command econony
        -   workers may work harder and think more about business if
            they have a stake in it
        -   basic right to start a business Arguments in support of
            socialism

    -   in democratic countries socialism is a form of democratic
        expression
    -   capitalism creates more inequality and less social mobility
        -   US 1% own 50% of assets
        -   inequality in wealth to corruption of democracy
        -   US farm bill: money to corporations, cut out food stamps

-   Market economy responds to price signals (US)
-   Command economy planned by government (USSR) (Germany WWI)
