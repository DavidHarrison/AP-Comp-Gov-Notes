    office to ethnically-based clients.

    are mobilized by politicians in order to lay claim to public
    resources
2.  The pursuit of rents by and office-holder, aon his own behalf and on
    behalf of his clients, in which the pursuit is justified in t terms
    of distributive fairness amonth ethnic and religious groups.

    participation) is the distribution of rents

        by government

    giving them access to rents without affecting policy
