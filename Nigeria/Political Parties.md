Nigeria's Political Parties
===========================

-   parties of the Fourth Republic are based on the parties of the First
    and Second Republics
-   under Babangida, two artificial parties created (one center-left,
    one center-right)

I.  The People's Democratic Party (PDP)
    A.  Founded by politicians from the northern conservative and
        progressive of the First and Second Republics, the eastern party
        of the Second Republic and from the Delta
        -   step towards reducing regional/ethnic tensions
        -   Obasanjo chosen to balance regional ties (from South-East)

    B.  Originally won support in the north and east; today, it wins in
        south and middle of the country (losing support in the North)

    C.  In 2011, it was the only political party in Nigeria with access
        to the resources needed to do favors for legislators, loyalists
        and voters

    -   only party able to build a clientelist machine (like PRI)

    D.  In danger of falling apart of Jonathan's potential reelection
        bid in 2015

II. The All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP)
    A.  Founded by Kanuri leaders and mid-Belt minority politicians and
        southern politicians close to Abacha
        -   includes other minorities from the north-east and the south
            and traditional Hausa-Fulani elites (Emirs)
        -   was a conservative party

    B.  In 2003 and 2007, it became a vehicle for General Buhari's
        presidential ambitions -- and for his call for a Shari'a based
        legal system
        -   12 states in the north have Shari'a based legal systems for
            Muslims

        1.  This gained the party support in the North, but cost the
            party support in the South

        2.  Following the 2007 election, ANPP leaders accepted the new
            President Yar'Adua invitation to join a "coalition"
            government

            -   PDP did not need ANPP support (had \~65% of seats),
                exercise in political cooptation
            -   Buhari leaves the ANPP

III. The Congress for Progressive Change (CPC)
    A.  In 2007, the ANPP accepted Yar'Adua's invitation to join the
        government
    B.  Buhari objected; he and his supporters founded the CPC
    C.  Won 32% of the vote in 2011 Presidential elections (as the major
        opposition party) (won 12 northernmost states)

    -   10% of House seats
    -   5-6% of Senate seats

IV. Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN)
    A.  Formerly Alliance for Democracy (AD) and Action Congress (AC)
    B.  Progressive pro-democracy party based in Western Nigeria
    C.  Won 5% of vote in 2011 presidential election (Nuhu Ribadu) --
        won one state in W. Nigeria
    D.  Based on Yoruba progressive parties of the First and Second
        Republics

V.  In 2013, the ANPP, CPC, ACN and one other party (based in the east)
    announced that they would form an electoral alliance in the 2015
    Presidential elections, which will be called the All Progressives
    Congress (APC).
    -   will run one candidate for each seat in the federal government
    -   in some places where one party is dominant, their candidate will
        likely become the APC candidate
    -   in places where all parties are active, the descision will be
        more difficult

-   most parties not strongly ideological
-   PDP designed as a patronage machine
    -   most aligned with center-right (pro economic liberalization)

-   ANPP most aligned with center-right as well as Shari'a
-   CPC under Buhari, would consider itself a center-left party
    (emphasizes equal nature of Islam)
-   ACN would consider itself a secular center-left party
-   PDP has (unofficially) split, one part (the "old" PDP) headed by
    Goodluck Jonothan, and another (the "new" PDP) lead by breakaway
    politicians

-   In the last presidential election, the CPC has won all Northern
    states, the PDP won all Middle Belt and Southern states except for
    one (won by the ACN)
