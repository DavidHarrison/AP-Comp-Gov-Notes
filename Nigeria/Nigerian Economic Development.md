Nigerian Economic Development
=============================

-   The Nigerian state is strongly **interventionist** -- it makes
    crucial decisions about the extraction deployment and allocation of
    resources
    -   mostly centered around oil and "hard currency"
    -   legacy of colonialism
        -   even though Britain and its settled colonies were
            liberally-democratic by the beginning of the 20th century,
            its non-settle colonies were authoritarian regimes built to
            serve the needs of the empire

-   All economic activity in Nigeria involves the state in some way
-   The state controls most of the nation's resources and nearly all of
    its "hard currency"
-   most of the governments revenue comes from oil
    -   much of Nigerias population works in the informal sector,
        meaning that taxes cannot be reliably collected
    -   generates 90% of foreign currency ("hard currency")
        -   USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF etc.

    -   means that the state controls what is imported and exported

-   "Rents" are politically-bestowed economic benefits (Nigerian
    government controls most of Nigeria's revenues and nearly all of its
    hard currency)
    -   comes from traditional economics centered around the use of land
        as the basis of economic productivity and that much of a
        countries money comes from selling resources
    -   can be welfare payments, jobs, contracts, licenses etc.

-   "Rent-seeking behaviour" is competition for government-issued
    licenses, government contracts, jobs, grants to state and local
    governments
    -   in US lobbyists are rent seekers
    -   in Nigeria, this competition is life or death, there is not
        enough to go around

- Commercial agriculture was supported by the British and post-independence government


- Between 1970 and 1978, Nigerian food imports rose by 700% (by value)
	- during the 1960s famine in Biafra because of civil war
	- in the 1970s, famine because of a drought
	- attributable to:
		- government policies going back to the British favor commercial over subsistence agriculture
		- rapid population growth (as with other sub-Saharan countries during the period)
		- diversion of investment funds from agriculture to petroleum

- oil boom allowed Nigeria to expand is spending on infrastructure
	- expenditures rose by ~600% of consumer goods
	- government begins to spend more on infrastructure than it is making from oil
