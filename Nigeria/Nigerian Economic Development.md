Nigerian Economic Development
=============================

-   The Nigerian state is strongly **interventionist** -- it makes
    crucial decisions about the extraction deployment and allocation of
    resources
    -   mostly centered around oil and "hard currency"
    -   legacy of colonialism
        -   even though Britain and its settled colonies were
            liberally-democratic by the beginning of the 20th century,
            its non-settle colonies were authoritarian regimes built to
            serve the needs of the empire

-   All economic activity in Nigeria involves the state in some way
-   The state controls most of the nation's resources and nearly all of
    its "hard currency"
-   most of the governments revenue comes from oil
    -   much of Nigerias population works in the informal sector,
        meaning that taxes cannot be reliably collected
    -   generates 90% of foreign currency ("hard currency")
        -   USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF etc.

    -   means that the state controls what is imported and exported

-   "Rents" are politically-bestowed economic benefits (Nigerian
    government controls most of Nigeria's revenues and nearly all of its
    hard currency)
    -   comes from traditional economics centered around the use of land
        as the basis of economic productivity and that much of a
        countries money comes from selling resources
    -   can be welfare payments, jobs, contracts, licenses etc.

-   "Rent-seeking behaviour" is competition for government-issued
    licenses, government contracts, jobs, grants to state and local
    governments
    -   in US lobbyists are rent seekers
    -   in Nigeria, this competition is life or death, there is not
        enough to go around

-   Commercial agriculture was supported by the British and
    post-independence government

-   Between 1970 and 1978, Nigerian food imports rose by 700% (by value)
    -   during the 1960s famine in Biafra because of civil war
    -   in the 1970s, famine because of a drought
    -   attributable to:
        -   government policies going back to the British favor
            commercial over subsistence agriculture
        -   rapid population growth (as with other sub-Saharan countries
            during the period)
        -   diversion of investment funds from agriculture to petroleum

Nigeria's Structural Adjustment
-------------------------------

-   During the 1970s oil boom, Nigeria
    -   increased spending on infrastructure (expenditures rose by 600%
        on both imports of capital goods and imports of consumer goods)
    -   increased the level of corruption in government (this did *not*
        change during the ensuing debt crisis)
        -   roughly 70% of oil revenues in Nigeria have disappeared

    -   government begins to spend more than it is making from oil
        (following Mexico)

-   In response to the debt crisis General Babangida develops a
    Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1985
    -   privitization of SOEs
        -   government owns banks, construction companies, commercial
            agriculture, manufacturing, public utilities
        -   even after privatization of many SOEs, 60% of jobs in the
            formal sector are with the state or SOEs (most people work
            in the informal sector) (privatization not successful in
            Nigeria, foreign investors are hesitant to invest in Nigeria
            (only oil has to invest in Nigeria) (other countries in Asia
            (China, S Korea) and Latin America (Mexico) look much better
            for investment)

    -   austerity
        -   charging for services

    -   currency devaluation
        -   raises the cost of foreign imports, which helps domestic
            producers, though make food more expensive

    -   reduction in tariffs

    -   liberalization of business regulations

-   The IMF endorses Nigerias SAP, allowing it to secure emergency loans
    that enable Nigeria to reschedule payment of its debts; ultimately
    paves the way for Nigeria to persuade its creditors to cancel most
    of its debts

-   Otherwise, the SAP does little to stimulate economic growth
    -   public is unhappy with austerity
    -   corruption in the program
    -   chronic instability limits FDI

-   In 1994, the Nigerian government (Abacha) begins to meet regularly
    with Nigerian and foreign business men active in Nigeria (Nigerian
    Economic Summit Group)
    -   organization still exists

-   In 1996, Abacha announces what he calls Vision 2010 -- his plan for
    reducing the role of the Nigerian government in the economy
    -   two reasons
        -   economic; neo-liberalism (all will benefit from a
            strengthened economy)
        -   takes pressure off the state, making political competition
            less violent

    -   Abacha appoints Ernest Shanekan (Babangida's appointed
        successor) to run Vision 2010

-   When Obasanjo becomes President in 1999, he continues to meet with
    the Nigerian Economic Summit Group and to follow the Vision 2010
    plan (not explicitly)

-   In 2003, Obasanjo announces his plan for liberalizing the economy
    (which builds on Vision 2010), called The National Economic
    Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS):
    -   Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala
    -   balanced budget (with many spending more on health, education
        and anti-poverty programs)
    -   stable interest rates
    -   restructuring the banking sector (and clean it up)
    -   prosecution of corrupt government officials and business men by
        the EFCC
        -   critical for convince foreign investors to forgive debt)

    -   continued privitization of SOEs (which foreign investors believe
        to be less efficient than private enterprise)
    -   increased prices for agricultural goods produced in Nigeria
        (encourage growers)
    -   expansion industry and infrastructure

Reward for Liberalization Policies
----------------------------------

-   In 2005, Nigeria's creditors agree to cancel 90% of Nigeria's debt
    over next two years
-   When Obasanjo leaves office in 2007, Nigeria is *debt free*
-   Government continues to reduce subsidies
	- reduces innefficient use of subsidized goods
