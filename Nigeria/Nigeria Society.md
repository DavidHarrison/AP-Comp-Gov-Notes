- Military regimes
- oil price collapse
- lots of hardship
- people turn to religion (generally stricter)
	- Saudis finances preachers to preach their stricter branch of Islam around the world
	- Born-again Christian's in the south
	- accentuates differences and becomes divisive
- Christians in the south see military governments as against them
	- historically, governments have been run by the north
	- early on, governments made attempts to appear even-handed
	- Buhari starts appealing to north
- growing fear in the south that north is not interested in the secularism of the state
- three sources of authority in Islam
	- Qu'ran: word of God, as revealed to Muhammad by an Archangel, written by a scribe
		- Shiite more flexible on the ability to interpret Qu'ran
	- Hadith: sayings of Muhammad (last of 28 prophets)
		- important, but not word of God
	- Shari'a
		- some directly from Qu'ran, some interpreted from Qu'ran
- in the 1990s, there was a growing movement for the institution of Shari'a
	- Since the prevalence of Islam in the north (1500s), religious courts solved civil disputes between Muslims
		- if the dispute included a non-Muslim, the dispute was resolved under Common Law (from British)
		- in the south Common Law is used throughout
	- non-Muslims are still under secular law
		- if a Muslim and non-Muslim commit a crime together, they face a different court system
			- this causes a problem in a country that is expected to treat all equally
	- in the north, the secular courts are seen as corrupt
		- belief that religious courts will be accountable to God and not involved in secular issues
- in the 1990s the Ogoni (living around oil production) started protests to get better treatment by government
	- led by Ken Saro-Wiwa
		- Nigeria suspended from Commonwealth
	- have formed armed movements like MEND
		- got money from "oil bunkering" (tapping oil) and kidnapping (mostly foreign oil workers)
			- some done for political reasons, some done for money
			- only times hostages were killed was when the government intervened
	- military heavy-handidness has made insurgency worse
	- in 2009, MEND militants were to report to camps
		- recieve amnesty
		- get job training etc.
		- when Yar'adua becomes sick, program falls apart and militants leave to the gangs
			- Jonathan makes an effort to recover program, only partially successful
		- possibility that MEND will reform

## National question: How should Nigeria be governed, given its diversity?
	- little question about whether Nigeria should be a country (all want access to oil revenue)
	- what should the institutions be?
	- how can all of the nations work together without believing they have been cheated?
