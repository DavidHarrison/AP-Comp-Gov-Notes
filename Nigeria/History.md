History
=======

-   one hand over of power between elected presidents
-   4 constitutions
-   in the 53 years it has been independent, it has been under military
    for the majority of the time

The First Republic (1960-66)
----------------------------

-   gained independence from Britain in 1960
-   was prepared for indepenence starting in 1946
    -   civil service is Africanized
    -   interim constitution for self-government in the 1950s
        -   divided into three states; North, West and East
        -   each state has equal sway (not democratic, North has a much
            greater population)

I.  First national election for Parliament held in 1959
    A.  Representation in the new Parliament in lower house of new
        Parliament is by population (single-member districts)
    B.  Universal suffrage in the south; universal male suffrage in the
        north (now universal suffrage in north as well)
    C.  Nigeria becomes independent (1960) -- PM Balewa

II. Nigeria has a Westminster system of government -- with federalism (3
    states, North, East and West)
    -   new elections at least every 5 years

    A.  Ceremonial Governor-General (Queen is the official Head of
        State) (switched to a Presidential republic in 1963) B.
        Parliamentry systems require consensus consensu and social trust
        to succeed because the governing party/parties are all powerful
        and the opposition is powerless. These things are not president
        in Nigeria. and the opposition is powerless. These things do not
        adequately exist in Nigeria.
        -   election of Goodluck Jonathan shows this sentiment when he
            broke the tradition of alternating northern and southern PDP
            Presidents

    -   thought to be a bad system for Nigeria (party in power has full
        power)
        -   Parliamentry systems require social consensus and trust (as
            in Britain) to not change the rules of the game
        -   these things do not exist in Nigeria
            -   Nigerians view all solutions as a zero-sum game (for
                every gain there will be a loss)

    -   ethnic basis of politics in the First Republic

III. Politics becomes ethnically-based
    A.  Each region becomes dominated by a single party which harrasses
        its opponents and dispense favors to its supporters (like PRI,
        more heavy handed)
    B.  The political parties vie for power in order to access federal
        resources (very limited at this point, without significant oil
        revenue, mostly development aid from US and UK)

    -   each region resents the other
        -   south dominates civil service, military and for the most
            part business
        -   north is politically dominant

    C.  1963 census crisis -\> 1964 census crisis -\> 1964 Parliamentry
        elections are held in districts drawn on the basis of obviously
        false census data
        -   1963, government attempts to conduct a census
            -   political boundaries depend on the census
            -   federal resources are often dependent on population
            -   last census taken in 1953 by the British, since then
                there has been a dramatic birth rate
            -   north reports \~33%
            -   in response east reports \~72%
            -   west reports \~69%
            -   north decides it has made a mistake, and reports a
                similar birth rate

        -   in 1964 the same thing happens again with a new census
        -   all regions convinced that the others have treated more than
            them

    D.  1964 Elections marred by violence and obvious fraud in many
        districts
        1.  New government is a coalition of the party that
            dominates/controls the north (socially and economically
            conservative) (won 162/167 seats in the north and no other
            seats) and a conservative party from the west (won 36/57
            seats in the west), the opposition is formed by the party
            that dominated the east (more progressive) and its
            progressive ally in western Nigeria
            -   west is politically competetive between rural and urban
                parties

    E.  State elections are scheduled for the west in 1965
        1.  violence so prevalent that federal government bans public
            gatherings and sends federal police to Western Nigeria
            (makes it difficult to conduct a campaign where radio is
            scarce)
        2.  conservative party, returned to power, orders the murder of
            opposition leaders; retaliatory mob violence ensues

    F.  On 1966-01-14, the leaders of the northern party and the two
        western parties meet to try to solve the violence -- by morning,
        all three are dead and the military has seized power
        -   end of the First Republic

The First Military Government(s) (1966-1979)
--------------------------------------------

-   full of young officers (some are still around) - in 1960 90% of
    officers are British; by 1966, 90% of the officers are African

I.  Military is disproportiaonately Igbo
    A.  The leader of the coup, Gen. Ironsi, is Igbo
    B.  When Ironsi announces a new constitution centralizing power in
        the federal government, anti-Igbo pogroms (mobs) break out in
        the north, killing hundreds
    C.  Ironsi overthrown in second military coup; Yakuba Gowon comes to
        power (compromise candidate: northern middle belt Christian Tiv)
    D.  The military commander of the eastern region General Ojukwu,
        refuses to recognize Gowon's authority
        1.  Anti-Igbo riots in north force over 1 million Igbo to flee
            to the east
        2.  General Ojukwu orders all non-easterners out of eastern
            Nigeria
        3.  Eastern Nigeria attempts to secede as Biafra
            -   civil war
                -   Nigeria blockades Biafra

            -   Biafra becomes synonimous with starvation
            -   hundreds of thousands die in the fighting or of
                starvation. War lasts 30 months: (1967-69/70)

II. General Gowon announces that he will stay in power only 6 more years
    while he transitions the country to civilian rule
    A.  When oil prices increase dramatically in 1973-74, Gowon spends a
        lot of it rebuilding and coniliating the east
        -   1973, war breaks out in the middle east, restricts supply to
            the West oil prices shoot up
        -   Nigerian oil becomes more profitable

    B.  Officers grow as corrupt and arrogant as the civilian
        politicians of the First Republic
        -   Gowon postpones the returning country to civilian rule
            indefinitely
        -   some discontent among military with corruption

    C.  Gowon is ousted by the reform-minded General Murtala Muhammed
        1.  Murtala fires corrupt state governors, civil servants
            (10,000) and officers (150), and outlines a plan for
            restoring civilian rule
        2.  Murtala assassinated in a failed coup attempt

III. Olusegun Obasanjo becomes military leader of Nigeria (serves 3
    years)
    -   portrays himself as thrust into power

    A.  Model of integrity as he continues preparations civilian rule
    B.  Press and other freedoms are extended
    C.  A new constitution drafted
    D.  7 new states are created to ease ethnic tensions
        -   tendency in Nigeria
        -   allows different regions a share of resources (allows local
            patronage)

    E.  General Obasanjo establishes a neutral federal electoral
        commision (FEDECO, now called INEC) (like IFE in Mexico)

The Second Republic (1979-83)
-----------------------------

-   Nigerians begin to think that First Republic was setup badly with an
    all power dominant party
-   looks for places where consensus among groups is required, finds US

I.  New Constitution modeled on the US system
    -   more or less the American system (no electoral college)

    A.  Directly elected President, elected seperately from the national
        legislature
        1.  President and VP serve four year terms
        2.  To be elected president a candidate needs a plurality of the
            popular vote and at least 1/4 of the vote in 2/3 of the
            states (requires President to be broadly acceptable)
            -   if a candidate recieves a plurality but not the regional
                requirement, the electoral commision can force a rerun
                or runoff (has never happened)

        3.  Bicameral legislature
            1.  Lower house (House of Representatives) elected by
                plurality in SMDs (no census conducted before 1979
                elections so district lines questionable)
            2.  Upper house (Senate) elected by states (at this point
                19)
            3.  Ban on the parties of the First Republic so they regroup
                under new names

II. The new "northern" party won the first presidential election in
    relatively free and honest elections

    A.  The party's presidential candidate wins \~33.8% of the vote
        (which is a plurality); and the party wins \~37.8% of the vote
        for the HR and \~37.4% of the vote for the Senate
    B.  The opposition parties charge that the winner did not gain 25%
        of the vote in 2/3 of states -- FEDECO rules against them
    C.  The new government quickly becomes unpopular
        1.  Rampand corruption and bribery
        2.  Decline in oil prices leads to a 60% drop in government
            revenues (oil earns 90% of Nigeria's foreign currency)
            -   in order to feed its people, the government must sell
                oil for foreign ("hard") currency

        3.  Federal and state governments cancel development projects,
            unable to pay salaries

    D.  Blatant fraud in 1983 elections
        1.  The electorate grows by 34% (disproportianately in the
            north)
            -   greater than reasonable population growth

        2.  Pre-marked ballots, bribed election officials, etc.
        3.  President "wins" 98% of vote -- ruling party expands control
            of governorships and wins 2/3 of the seats in HR
        4.  Military overthrows the government

Military Government (1983-1993)
-------------------------------

-   clean house
-   northern regime

I.  President, VP, governors, cabinet members and hundreds of civil
    servants are arrested on corruption charges
    -   enjoys some legitimacy (cleaning up a corrupt civilian
        government)

II. Harsh restrictions on civil liberties
    -   make people uneasy

    A.  Anyone who criticizes the new government is arrested
    B.  Critical newspapers are banned

    -   begins to erode regime's legitimacy

III. The new regime begins to lose legitimacy
    A.  The military government of Gen. Buhari (later Presidential
        candidate in 4th republic) is more aggressive in prosecuting
        southern politicians for corruption than for northern
        politicians
    B.  The economic crisis continues: unemployment, inflation and
        government debt increase
        -   unable to pay off interest

    C.  Military announces it will govern country indefinitely

IV. 1985, Gen. Buhari is deposed by Gen. Babangida (still active in
    politics) who eventually assumes the title of prsident
    A.  Serving politicians are banned from public office for a decade
    B.  Journalists released and inspectors allowed to inspect detention
        centers -- but anyone who criticizes the government is arrested
    C.  In 1986, Nigeria adopts a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to
        secure IMF assistance (harsher than what would have been imposed
        by the IMF on a country as poor as Nigeria)
        1.  Harsh austerity measures
            -   results in deaths

        2.  Adoption of pro-market economic liberalization policies

    D.  Babangida announces a phased restoration of civilian rule
        -   put off by Babangida

        1.  In 1988, a constituent assembly drafts a new constitution
        2.  All politicians from the frist two republics are prohibited
            from running in the first round of elections
        3.  Only two parties allowes
            a.  Social Democratic Party (center-left)
            b.  National Republican Party (center-right)

        -   cross cutting candidates and tickets in the elections

        4.  Election of 1993 (Third Republic)
            a.  30% turnout (relatively low)
            b.  Unofficial results show Abiola of the SDP winning with
                about 55% of the vote
                -   Nigerians wistful of Abiola victory thinking it
                    could have been a turning point

            c.  military nullifies the vote, stays in power
            d.  Protests throughout Nigeria

        5.  Babangida turns power over to a civilian named Ernest
            Shanekan (former conglomerate CEO and Babangida ally),
            widely seen as a puppet
        6.  Supreme court rules that Shanekan was illegaly installed
        7.  General Sani Abacha seizes power
            -   originally from Kano (not Housa-Falani)
            -   most corrupt government in Nigerian history
                -   Abacha's family takes \$5 billion out of th country
                -   member of Abacha's family has the sole license to
                    import oil products

Military Rule (1993 - 99)
-------------------------

-   Abacha appoints Abiola's running mate to the cabinet

I.  In 1994, Abiola says that he is the rightful President of Nigeria.
    Abacha responds by
    A.  arresting Abiola and dozens of his supporters
    B.  disbanding *all* political organizations

II. Opposition responds with a long series of strikes, concentrated in
    the petroleum industry in the Niger Delta
    A.  Crackdown on all critics of the government -- results in the
        execution of a well-known author and environmentalist, Ken
        Saro-Wiwa (1995)
        -   Saro-Wiwa was critical of government's association with
            Shell Oil
        -   Shell has been forced to pay out millions in compensation to
            those killed under Abacha with the
        -   international against Abacha government

    B.  Abacha purges his cabinet, trade uions, and the Army and the
        Navy
        1.  Wole Soyinka forced into exile
        2.  Obasanjo arrested, imprisoned and sentenced to death (never
            executed)

III. Abiola dies in jail under mysterious circumstances. Later that
    year, Abacha under mysterious circumstances. (both said to have had
    heart-attacks)

The Fourth Republic (1999 - Present)
------------------------------------

-   parties reform (each of the 9 approved are regionally based)

I.  Only three parties do well enought in the state and local elections
    to be eligible to nominate candidats for federal elections in 1999
    A.  People's Democratic Party (PDP)
        1.  Led by Obasanjo (born-again Christian)
        2.  Party is backed by the "big men" from the north who backed
            the dominant northern party in the first two republics

        -   becomes the patronage machine of Nigeria

    B.  All People's Party (APP -- later the ANPP (All Nigeria People's
        Party))
        1.  Started by politicians close to Abacha (a northern Muslim)

        -   originally and Igbo base

        2.  In the 2000s, ANPP becomes the party associated with the
            Shari'a campaign (dual system in some northern states
            (Shari'a for Muslims, secular for others))
            -   no longer popular among the Igbo

    C.  Alliance for Democracy (AD -- later AC (Action Congress); today,
        ACN (Action Congress of Nigeria))
        1.  Consists of pro-democracy Abiola supporters
        2.  Supported by most Yoruba, many Igbo

    -   loosely based on the regional parties of the past, though with
        greater inclusion

II. Elections of 1999
    A.  PDP candidate for President (Obasanjo) wins 62.8% of vote; PDP
        cnadiates for HR win 58% of vote
    B.  APP and AD united to back the same candidate Aloof Ali. Obasanjo
        runs well in the north and the east, but not in the west (where
        he is from)
        -   union is treacherous due to past support for Abacha and
            Abiola respectively

    -   today, the south has mostly votes for the PDP (with one urban
        state voting for the ACN), the north mostly votes for the APP
    -   "Zoning Agreement"; the PDP candidate is:
        -   rotated among six regions of the country
        -   alternating between north and south
        -   balanced by a running mate of the other of north or south
        -   dispute caused by Goodluck Jonathan re-running after his
            partial term
            -   causing the PDP to fall apart

III. Elections of 2003
    A.  Elections successful -- turnout of 67% (turnout was only 30% in
        1999)
        1.  Minor irregularities -- court challenges thrown out
        2.  INEC cancels the results of some gubernatorial elections and
            requires them to be re-run
            -   INEC has a technology-sharing agreement with IFE in
                Mexico

    B.  Presidential candidates
        1.  PDP - Obansajo (wins w/ 61.9% of vote)
            -   hero during his military rule
            -   establishes second republic

        2.  ANPP - Buhari
            -   ends second republic

        3.  Independent Candidate - Ojukwo
            -   leader of Biafran secession movement

    C.  PDP wins 55% of vote for HR
