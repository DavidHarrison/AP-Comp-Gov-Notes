# History
- one hand over of power between elected presidents
- 4 constitutions
- in the 53 years it has been independent, it has been under military for the majority of the time

## The First Republic (1960-66)
- gained independence from Britain in 1960
- was prepared for indepenence starting in 1946
	- civil service is Africanized
	- interim constitution for self-government in the 1950s
		- divided into three states; North, West and East
		- each state has equal sway (not democratic, North has a much greater population)
I.  First national election for Parliament held in 1959
	A.  Representation in the new Parliament in lower house of new Parliament is by population (single-member districts)
	B.  Universal suffrage in the south; universal male suffrage in the north (now universal suffrage in north as well)
	C.  Nigeria becomes independent (1960) -- PM Balewa
II.  Nigeria has a Westminster system of government -- with federalism (3 states, North, East and West)
	- new elections at least every 5 years
	A.  Ceremonial Governor-General (Queen is the official Head of State) (switched to a Presidential republic in 1963)
	B. Parliamentry systems require consensus consensu and social trust to succeed because the governing party/parties are all powerful and the opposition is powerless. These things are not president in Nigeria. and the opposition is powerless. These things do not adequately exist in Nigeria.
		- election of Goodluck Jonathan shows this sentiment when he broke the tradition of alternating northern and southern PDP Presidents
	- thought to be a bad system for Nigeria (party in power has full power)
		- Parliamentry systems require social consensus and trust (as in Britain) to not change the rules of the game
		- these things do not exist in Nigeria
			- Nigerians view all solutions as a zero-sum game (for every gain there will be a loss)
	- ethnic basis of politics in the First Republic
III.  Politics becomes ethnically-based
	A.  Each region becomes dominated by a single party which harrasses its opponents and dispense favors to its supporters (like PRI, more heavy handed)
	B.  The political parties vie for power in order to access federal resources (very limited at this point, without significant oil revenue, mostly development aid from US and UK)
	- each region resents the other
		- south dominates civil service, military and for the most part business
		- north is politically dominant
	C.  1963 census crisis -> 1964 census crisis -> 1964 Parliamentry elections are held in districts drawn on the basis of obviously false census data
		- 1963, government attempts to conduct a census
			- political boundaries depend on the census
			- federal resources are often dependent on population
			- last census taken in 1953 by the British, since then there has been a dramatic birth rate
			- north reports ~33%
			- in response east reports ~72%
			- west reports ~69%
			- north decides it has made a mistake, and reports a similar birth rate
		- in 1964 the same thing happens again with a new census
		- all regions convinced that the others have treated more than them
	D.  1964 Elections marred by violence and obvious fraud in many districts
		1.  New government is a coalition of the party that dominates/controls the north (socially and economically conservative) (won 162/167 seats in the north and no other seats) and a conservative party from the west (won 36/57 seats in the west), the opposition is formed by the party that dominated the east (more progressive) and its progressive ally in western Nigeria
			- west is politically competetive between rural and urban parties
	E.  State elections are scheduled for the west in 1965
		1.  violence so prevalent that federal government bans public gatherings and sends federal police to Western Nigeria (makes it difficult to conduct a campaign where radio is scarce)
		2.  conservative party, returned to power, orders the murder of opposition leaders; retaliatory mob violence ensues
	F.  On 1966-01-14, the leaders of the northern party and the two western parties meet to try to solve the violence -- by morning, all three are dead and the military has seized power
		- end of the First Republic

## The First Military Government(s) (1966-1979)
- full of young officers (some are still around)
- in 1960 90% of officers are British; by 1966, 90% of the officers are African
I.  Military is disproportiaonately Igbo
	A.  The leader of the coup, Gen. Ironsi, is Igbo
	B.  When Ironsi announces a new constitution centralizing power in the federal government, anti-Igbo pogroms (mobs) break out in the north, killing hundreds
	C.  Ironsi overthrown in second military coup; Yakuba Gowon comes to power (compromise candidate: northern middle belt Christian Tiv)
	D.  The military commander of the eastern region General Ojukwu, refuses to recognize Gowon's authority
		1.  Anti-Igbo riots in north force over 1 million Igbo to flee to the east
		2.  General Ojukwu orders all non-easterners out of eastern Nigeria
		3.  Eastern Nigeria attempts to secede as Biafra
			- civil war
				- Nigeria blockades Biafra
			- Biafra becomes synonimous with starvation
			- hundreds of thousands die in the fighting or of starvation. War lasts 30 months: (1967-69/70)
II.  General Gowon announces that he will stay in power only 6 more years while he transitions the country to civilian rule
	A.  When  oil prices increase dramatically in 1973-74, Gowon spends a lot of it rebuilding and coniliating the east
		- 1973, war breaks out in the middle east, restricts supply to the West oil prices shoot up
		- Nigerian oil becomes more profitable
	B.  Officers grow as corrupt and arrogant as the civilian politicians of the First Republic
		- Gowon postpones the returning country to civilian rule indefinitely
		- some discontent among military with corruption
	C.  Gowon is ousted by the reform-minded General Murtala Muhammed
		1.  Murtala fires corrupt state governors, civil servants (10,000) and officers (150), and outlines a plan for restoring civilian rule
		2.  Murtala assassinated in a failed coup attempt
III.  Olusegun Obasanjo becomes military leader of Nigeria (serves 3 years)
	- portrays himself as thrust into power
	A.  Model of integrity as he continues preparations civilian rule
	B.  Press and other freedoms are extended
	C.  A new constitution drafted
	D.  7 new states are created to ease ethnic tensions
		- tendency in Nigeria
		- allows different regions a share of resources (allows local patronage)
	E.  General Obasanjo establishes a neutral federal electoral commision (FEDECO, now called INEC) (like IFE in Mexico) 

## The Second Republic (1979-83)
- Nigerians begin to think that First Republic was setup badly with an all power dominant party
- looks for places where consensus among groups is required, finds US
I.  New Constitution modeled on the US system
	- more or less the American system (no electoral college)
	A.  Directly elected President, elected seperately from the national legislature
		1.  President and VP serve four year terms
		2.  To be elected president a candidate needs a plurality of the popular vote and at least 1/4 of the vote in 2/3 of the states (requires President to be broadly acceptable)
			- if a candidate recieves a plurality but not the regional requirement, the electoral commision can force a rerun or runoff (has never happened)
		3.  Bicameral legislature
			1.  Lower house (House of Representatives) elected by plurality in SMDs (no census conducted before 1979 elections so district lines questionable)
			2.  Upper house (Senate) elected by states (at this point 19)
			3.  Ban on the parties of the First Republic so they regroup under new names
