Political Economy
=================

I.  Nigeria politics is a zero-sum competition for resources among
    individuals, loyalty pyramids and ethnic communities
    -   view that only one person can win from politics
    -   does not have a prevalent notion of the "common good" in Nigeria
        and the belief in win-win compromises

Important Interest Groups
-------------------------

-   Women's organizations
    -   women are the most marginalized group in Nigeria
        -   despite dominance in agriculture, however, men owned land
        -   women important in Yoruba trade, but trade regulated by men
        -   make up less than 10% of federal politicians

    -   women's organizations are spreading, including to those who are
        not affluent
    -   micro-credit organizations are reaching women
        -   in Nigeria, most small loans are made by banks at high
            interest rates

-   Labor Organizations
    -   two million members
    -   concentrated in the petroleum industry (skilled workers who are
        difficult to replace) and in the public sector
    -   unions opposed the Babangida and Abacha governments, which tried
        to co-opt their leader and supress the rank-and-file
    -   strikes forced Obasanjo to cancel plans to increase fuel costs,
        and raise wages for formal sector workers
    -   strikes forced Jonathan to limit fuel price increases
        -   limiting of fuel price increases lead to inefficient use of
            subsized resources, and inefficient targeting of the poor

-   Economic Summit Group
    -   represents business
    -   formed of Nigerian and foreign business owners operating in
        Nigeria
    -   meets once a year with the government
    -   formed in 1996 by Abacha

-   Student groups
    -   many protests Yoruba universities
    -   many student protests during Babangida and Abacha regimes, which
        were put down by the leaders

-   NGOs
    -   anti-corruption, civil rights, environmental
    -   often backed by funds from N. American and W. Europe

-   Press
    -   free
    -   agressive
    -   blunt/irreverent about government and business leadership
    -   often funny
    -   most comparable to tabloid press
    -   have been bombed by Boko Haram in an effort to intimidate
        journalists
        -   most danger to freedom of press is insurgent groups (like
            drug-gangs in Mexico)
