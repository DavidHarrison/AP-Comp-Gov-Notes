Nigerian Government
===================

-   central question: How should Nigeria be governed, given its
    diversity?

Executive Dominance
-------------------

I.  1999 Constitution is modeled on US government
    A.  Includes a separation of powers amoung a strong President
        elected by the people of Nigeria, a bicameral legislature and a
        theoretically independent judiciary
    B.  Nigeria has a federal structure with 36 states, a national
        capital territory and 776 local governments
        1.  State and local governments created top-down
            -   states originally from British colonial division, have
                multiplied over time

        2.  The Consitution gives limited powers to the states
            -   unused power to tax

        3.  States do not use taxation powers; instead depending on
            revenue grants from the federal government (oil money)

    C.  Federal Character: The composition in ethnic terms of civil
        service, state owned enterprises and businesses with federal
        contracts must reflect the federal character of Nigeria (jobs go
        in proportion to national ethnic composition)
        -   designed to lower the competition among ethnic groups
        -   may:
            -   encourage Nigerians to look at government jobs as
                "rent-seeking"
            -   exacerbate ethnic conflict - increases ethnic
                conciousness (counting hires)
            -   cause an overload of political system (to many demands
                for jobs
            -   compromise integrity of government (citizens see public
                sector as hired for ethnicity, not merit)

II. In reality, the Nigerian government is dominated by the executive
    branch
    A.  Legacy of First Republic (fusion-of-powers system) and sucessive
        military governments
        -   stems from British colonialism (Nigeria along with most
            other colonies were not run as democracies)

        1.  Buhari, Babangida and Abacha were each more authoritarian,
            brutal, pro-northern in bias and corruption than their
            predecessor
        2.  Power under the military was exercised in discretionary and
            personalistic ways, resulting in the development of
            patron-client relationships at all levels of government

        -   need to treat inferiors well to keep a power base and avoid
            being overthrown

    B.  Obasanjo maintained a tradition of strong executive power
        -   forced retirment of military government officials
        -   with pensions etc. to keep them quiet
        -   "truth seeking" commission
            -   amnesty for those who admit crimes

        -   foreign peace-keeping
            -   keeps military satisfied and out of Nigeria
            -   attempts to professionalize military, sending officers
                to US and UK, to give idea that civilians control
                military not vice-versa

        -   prosecution of EFCC (stopping before "big men")
            -   begins to be used by Obasanjo for political reasons

III. State-owned enterprises in Nigeria
    -   idea that Nigerians collectively own resources to better country
        and give services at lowest price to Nigerians
    -   in reality, a source of patronage, co-optation and graft

    A.  At independence, the judiciary was competent and respected
    B.  Years of military rule destroyed the judiciary
        1.  The military improved judicial decrees
        2.  Judges threatened by the military
        3.  Judges appointed based on services rendered and not on
            compettence; bribery rampant

        -   caused a loss of respect for the judiciary and the idea of
            rule of law
        -   source for call for Shari'a
        -   In the aftermath of the corrupt 2007 elections, the courts
            did invalidate a lot of results and ordered elections re-run
            -   beneficial for perception of secular courts

IV. State and local governments not independent of the fedral government
    A.  Number of states and localities increased (3 to 36 states)
        -   theoretically improves ethnic justice
        -   in reality, gives local elites access to resources and
            greater oppurtunities for dispensing rents (jobs, contracts,
            cash, etc.) to supporters
	1.  State and local governments are an exercise in clientilism and corruption
	2.  None the less key problems have emerged at the state and local levels (Boko Haram, MEND, etc.)
