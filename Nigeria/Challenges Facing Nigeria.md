Challenges Facing Nigeria
=========================

Patrimonialism
--------------

-   A regime in which a single ruler treats all of the property of "his"
    country as his personal property
    -   eg Tsarist Russia, Shah of Iran

-   Nigeria under Buhari, Babangida and Abacha was patrimonial
-   in a patrimonial system, authority is maintained through patronage
-   even now, Nigeria has a patrimonial/parasitic class, who treat the
    property and revenue (oil money) as their personal property to
    dispense to themeselves and their "clients"
-   rival groups compete fiercely and violently for their "rents"
    (prebendalism)

### What can be done?

-   establish a politically viable, loyal (to the constitutional) and
    multi-ethnic, opposition party
    -   opposition to the PDP
    -   APC may be able to do this
        -   multi-ethic and regional
        -   political viability and loyalty unclear

-   decentralize power away from the President to other branches of the
    federal government
-   decentralize power to the states and local governments
    -   revenue sharing (like Mexico)

-   privatizes SOEs
    -   decentralizes power away from the government
    -   people spend more time trying to compete in business rather than
        government
        -   may not work in this wage (eg Russia, created oligarchs)

-   encouraging civil society groups

-   economic diversification
    -   while revenues go to private interests, and not reinvested in
        Nigeria, the country has no future
        -   also need to combat corruption

-   radical downward distribution of revenues
    -   poverty gives rise to extremist groups
    -   possible case for forced Communism
