Nigeria Since 1999
==================

I.  Obasanjo’s First Term (1999-2003)
    A.  Cabinet includes “big men” (mostly from North)
        1.  Corrupt businessmen and politicians who brought down 1st
            colluded with Babangida and Abacha
        2.  No prosecution of these men possible
        3.  Their presence in the Cabinet had little effect on policy

    B.  Cabinet also includes Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (World Bank economist)
        as Finance Minister
        1.  Manages Nigeria’s debt efficiently
        2.  Persuades Nigeria’s foreign creditors to forgive Nigeria’s
            debt in phases, over time, in return for partial repayments
            of debt
        3.  Extremely effective at managing the Treasury and financial
            control – so much so that Obasanjo moves her to the Foreign
            Ministry late in his second term
            a.  Resigns as Foreign Minister after 6 months
            b.  Became Finance Minister again in 2011 under Jonathan

    C.  Obasanjo nearly removed from office by impeachment in 2003
        1.  Obasanjo avoided removal by apologizing to National Assembly
            (his supporters also likely paid off a few Senators)
        2.  Obasanjo ensures that impeachment leaders not nominated in
            PDP primary elections in 2003
        3.  Nonetheless, Obasanjo more respectful of National Assembly
            afterwards

    D.  Establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
        (EFCC) under Nuhu Ribadu

II. Obasanjo’s Second Term (2003-2007)
    A.  Ribadu begins to prosecute many Nigerian politicians, including
        PDP insiders, and launches investigations of “big men” close to
        Obasanjo
        1.  After 2006, powers weakened informally (through staff cuts,
            etc.) – key insiders protected
        2.  Ribadu removed by Yar’Adua after 2007 election

    B.  Obasanjo tries unsuccessfully to persuade National Assembly to
        amend constitution to allow him to seek a third term
        1.  Measure defeated in Senate after intense lobbying by
            Vice-President Attiku Abubakar
        2.  Obasanjo then blocks Abubakar from becoming 2007 PDP
            presidential nominee
        3.  Nomination goes to Umaru Yar’Adua under the PDP “Zoning
            Agreement”
            a.  Yar’Adua is the honest governor of a northwestern state
            b.  Yar’Adua is the younger brother of an Obasanjo friend
                (and army general)

        4.  Abubakar runs as the candidate of the “liberal democratic”
            Action Congress (later the Action Congress of Nigeria)
            a.  EFCC investigation results in Abubakar’s removal from
                the ballot
            b.  Supreme Court orders Abubakar’s name put back on ballot;
                ballots must be reprinted

    C.  2007 Presidential, National Assembly, state and local elections
        regarded as the most fraudulent in Nigerian history
        1.  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the
            courts annul the results of dozens of senate and
            gubernatorial elections, but not the presidential election
        2.  Lots of state and local officials (inc. a number of PDP
            governors) prosecuted for corruption

    D.  When Obasanjo leaves office, Nigeria is debt free

III. Yar’Adua’s Presidency (2007-2010)
    A.  Yar’Adua’s Inauguration is the first successful transfer of
        power between civilians in Nigerian history
    B.  Henry Okah (head of MEND) captured; while in prison, he
        negotiates a peace and amnesty agreement between MEND and the
        Nigerian government
        1.  Thousands of MEND fighters report to camps and surrender
            weapons
        2.  When promised education and jobs fail to materialize (during
            Yar’Adua’s long illness) the fighters begin to drift away
            from the camps and into the Delta’s criminal gangs
        3.  Jonathan has attempted to carry out the agreement and keep
            the peace process alive, but Delta is rife with “oil
            bunkering” and kidnapping for ransom, and (as of 2013) there
            are threats of renewed MEND violence

    C.  Most violence in Nigeria now comes from other sources
        1.  Two jihadi groups in northern Nigeria – Boko Haram and
            Ansaru
            a.  Boko Haram’s first leader did in police custody in 2009
                after a failed armed insurrection
            b.  Boko Haram has conducted military actions, jail breaks
                and terror bombings

        2.  Communal violence on the Jos plateau between Berom Christian
            farmers (long settled in area) and Hausa-Fulani Muslim
            herders (recently arrived in area)
        3.  Excessive and arbitrary violence by Nigerian armed forces,
            and serious human rights violations, complicate peace-making
            in all regions of Nigeria

    D.  Yar’Adua developed pericarditis in Nov. 2009, and left for
        treatment in Saudi Arabia. His departure left a power vacuum.
        1.  Pretense continued for months that Yar’Adua was running
            Nigeria from hospital
        2.  Cabinet failed to exercise its authority to transfer power
            to Vice President Jonathan
        3.  Yar’Adua never formally wrote the Senate saying that he was
            ill and asking Vice President Jonathan to act in his stead
        4.  Nigerian Senate adopted a resolution declaring that Yar’Adua
            had notified the Senate of his incapacity by appearing
            deathly ill in a BBC interview, and transferred his power to
            Jonathan

IV. Jonathan’s Presidency (2010-present)
    A.  Jonathan became acting president in Feb. 2012 and succeeded to
        the presidency when Yar’Adua died in May 2010.
        1.  Fired most of Yar’Adua’s Cabinet but reappointed key
            Yar’Adua and PDP supporters
        2.  Announced plans to reform power sector by inviting
            investment by private and foreign investors

    B.  Jonathan stunned Nigeria by announcing he would run for the
        presidency in 2011 notwithstanding the PDP’s “Zoning Agreement”
        1.  Won 77.7% of vote in PDP primary
        2.  Won 58.8% of vote in general elections generally regarded as
            unusually free and fair
        3.  Violence during first phase of election forced delays in
            later phases of election
        4.  Riots in north followed Jonathan’s inauguration

    C.  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala appointed Finance Minister
        1.  Plans to eliminate fuel subsidies (a lucrative opportunity
            for graft as well as a distortion of the market) thwarted by
            strikes and riots requiring military patrols in Nigerian
            cities; subsidies partially restored (gas prices allowed to
            rise 33%)
        2.  Failure of subsidy reform and Boko Haram insurgency imperil
            power privatization plans
        3.  Jonathan and Okonjo-Iweala propose allowing private
            investment in the state-owned oil company

    D.  In 2013, Jonathan suggests that he might seek reelection in
        2015, upsetting northerners in the PDP who believe that it
        should be their region's "turn" at the presidency and other
        members frustrated that Jonathan has done little to end
        organized crime in the south and Islamist insurgencies in the
        north.
        1.  Conflicts within the Party come out into the open when many
            senators and governors leave the "old PDP" to form the "new
            PDP”
        2.  Jonathan sacks cabinet officers with ties to "new PDP"
            officials
        3.  At the same time, the four major opposition political
            parties announced they would band together to fight the PDP
            in the 2015 presidential and National Assembly elections
