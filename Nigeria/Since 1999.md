Nigeria Since 1999
==================

(from handout)

-   PDP has been a clientilist party
    -   based on old Northern ruling party

I.  Obasanjo’s First Term (1999-2003)
    A.  Cabinet includes “big men” (mostly from North)
        1.  Corrupt businessmen and politicians who brought down 1st
            colluded with Babangida and Abacha
        2.  No prosecution of these men possible (too powerful)
        3.  Their presence in the Cabinet had little effect on policy
            (mostly there to collect "rents")

    B.  Cabinet also includes Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (World Bank economist)
        as Finance Minister
        1.  Manages Nigeria’s debt efficiently
        2.  Persuades Nigeria’s foreign creditors to forgive Nigeria’s
            debt in phases, over time, in return for partial repayments
            of debt
        3.  Extremely effective at managing the Treasury and financial
            control – so much so that Obasanjo moves her to the Foreign
            Ministry late in his second term
            a.  Resigns as Foreign Minister after 6 months
            b.  Became Finance Minister again in 2011 under Jonathan

    C.  Obasanjo nearly removed from office by impeachment in 2003
        1.  Obasanjo avoided removal by apologizing to National Assembly
            (his supporters also likely paid off a few Senators)
            -   has lead following Presidents to respect the NA more

        2.  Obasanjo ensures that impeachment leaders not nominated in
            PDP primary elections in 2003
        3.  Nonetheless, Obasanjo more respectful of National Assembly
            afterwards

    D.  Establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
        (EFCC) under Nuhu Ribadu
        -   Ribadu has a reputation for honesty
        -   begins to target high profile politicians en masse
        -   when he gets close to the "big men" (who really control the
            federal government) his department is restricted

II. Obasanjo’s Second Term (2003-2007)
    A.  Ribadu begins to prosecute many Nigerian politicians, including
        PDP insiders, and launches investigations of “big men” close to
        Obasanjo
        1.  After 2006, powers weakened informally (through staff cuts,
            etc.) – key insiders protected
        2.  Ribadu removed by Yar’Adua after 2007 election

    B.  Obasanjo tries unsuccessfully to persuade National Assembly to
        amend constitution to allow him to seek a third term

    -   Potentially dangerous to allow more terms in countries like
        Nigeria
        1.  Measure defeated in Senate after intense lobbying by
            Vice-President Attiku Abubakar
        2.  Obasanjo then blocks Abubakar from becoming 2007 PDP
            presidential nominee
        3.  Nomination goes to Umaru Yar’Adua under the PDP “Zoning
            Agreement”
            a.  Yar’Adua is the honest governor of a northwestern state
            b.  Yar’Adua is the younger brother of an Obasanjo friend
                (and army general)

        4.  Abubakar runs as the candidate of the “liberal democratic”
            Action Congress (later the Action Congress of Nigeria)

        -   traditionally a southern candidate, potential to benifit
            from a northern candidate
            a.  EFCC investigation results in Abubakar’s removal from
                the ballot

        -   shows change to political institution
            b.  Supreme Court orders Abubakar’s name put back on ballot;
                ballots must be reprinted

        -   ballots printed in South Africa and kept under ZA and NG
            military to prevent pre-marking

    C.  2007 Presidential, National Assembly, state and local elections
        regarded as the most fraudulent in Nigerian history
        1.  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the
            courts annul the results of dozens of senate and
            gubernatorial elections, but not the presidential election

        -   polls suggest that Yar'Adua would have won anyway (though
            polls in Nigeria are problematic)

        2.  Lots of state and local officials (inc. a number of PDP
            governors) prosecuted for corruption

    D.  When Obasanjo leaves office, Nigeria is debt free

III. Yar’Adua’s Presidency (2007-2010)
    A.  Yar’Adua’s Inauguration is the first successful transfer of
        power between civilians in Nigerian history (despite not being
        substantially democratic)
    B.  Henry Okah (head of MEND) captured; while in prison, he
        negotiates a peace and amnesty agreement between MEND and the
        Nigerian government
        1.  Thousands of MEND fighters report to camps and surrender
            weapons
        2.  When promised education and jobs fail to materialize (during
            Yar’Adua’s long illness) the fighters begin to drift away
            from the camps and into the Delta’s criminal gangs
        3.  Jonathan (and Ijaw from the Delta) has attempted to carry
            out the agreement and keep the peace process alive, but
            Delta is rife with “oil bunkering” and kidnapping for
            ransom, and (as of 2013) there are threats of renewed MEND
            violence

    C.  Most violence in Nigeria now comes from other sources
        1.  Two jihadi groups in northern Nigeria – Boko Haram
            (north-east) and Ansaru
            a.  Boko Haram’s first leader did in police custody in 2009
                after a failed armed insurrection
            b.  Boko Haram has conducted military actions, jail breaks
                and terror bombings

        2.  Communal violence on the Jos plateau between Berom Christian
            farmers (long settled in area) and Hausa-Fulani Muslim
            herders (recently arrived in area)
        3.  Excessive and arbitrary violence by Nigerian armed forces,
            and serious human rights violations, complicate peace-making
            in all regions of Nigeria (and potentially give recruiting
            potential to terrorist groups)

    D.  Yar’Adua developed pericarditis in Nov. 2009, and left for
        treatment in Saudi Arabia. His departure left a power vacuum.
        1.  Pretense continued for months that Yar’Adua was running
            Nigeria from hospital
        2.  Cabinet failed to exercise its authority to transfer power
            to Vice President Jonathan
        3.  Yar’Adua never formally wrote the Senate saying that he was
            ill and asking Vice President Jonathan to act in his stead
        4.  Nigerian Senate adopted a resolution declaring that Yar’Adua
            had notified the Senate of his incapacity by appearing
            deathly ill in a BBC interview, and transferred his power to
            Jonathan

IV. Jonathan’s Presidency (2010-present)
    A.  Jonathan became acting president in Feb. 2010 and succeeded to
        the presidency when Yar’Adua died in May 2010.
        1.  Fired most of Yar’Adua’s Cabinet but reappointed key
            Yar’Adua and PDP supporters
            -   shows that he has nothing against Yar'Adua or the north

        2.  Announced plans to reform power sector by inviting
            investment by private and foreign investors

    B.  Jonathan stunned Nigeria by announcing he would run for the
        presidency in 2011 notwithstanding the PDP’s “Zoning Agreement”
        1.  Won 77.7% of vote in PDP primary
        2.  Won 58.8% of vote in general elections generally regarded as
            unusually free and fair

        -   wins every state in the south and middle belt except one
            (won by Ribadu)
        -   north is swept by a northern candidate

        3.  Violence during first phase of election forced delays in
            later phases of election
        4.  Riots in north followed Jonathan’s inauguration

    C.  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala appointed Finance Minister
        -   shows Jonathan's commitment to liberalization and fighting
            corruption

        -   Electricity
            -   electricity is unstable in Nigeria, which makes it
                difficult to attract industry
            -   idea to allow private investment to improve system

        -   Oil
            -   more contentious

        -   Price Subsidies
            -   Nigerian government sells oil to multi-nationals
            -   government buys back the oil and sells it to consumers
                at subsidized rates
            -   many countries have found that subsidies are
                innefficient at helping the poor - in Tehran, where oil
                is subsidized, when it is hot, people drive around with
                the AC on
                -   subsidies not only help the poor but also the middle
                    class

        1.  Plans to eliminate fuel subsidies (a lucrative opportunity
            for graft as well as a distortion of the market) thwarted by
            strikes and riots requiring military patrols in Nigerian
            cities; subsidies partially restored (gas prices allowed to
            rise 33%)
        2.  Failure of subsidy reform and Boko Haram insurgency imperil
            power privatization plans
        3.  Jonathan and Okonjo-Iweala propose allowing private
            investment in the state-owned oil company

    D.  In 2013, Jonathan suggests that he might seek reelection in
        2015, upsetting northerners in the PDP who believe that it
        should be their region's "turn" at the presidency and other
        members frustrated that Jonathan has done little to end
        organized crime in the south and Islamist insurgencies in the
        north.
        1.  Conflicts within the Party come out into the open when many
            senators and governors leave the "old PDP" to form the "new
            PDP”
        2.  Jonathan sacks cabinet officers with ties to "new PDP"
            officials
        3.  At the same time, the four major opposition political
            parties announced they would band together to fight the PDP
            in the 2015 presidential and National Assembly elections
