Nigeria's Political Parties
===========================

-   parties of the Fourth Republic are based on the parties of the First
    and Second Republics
-   under Babangida, two artificial parties created (one center-left,
    one center-right)

I.  The People's Democratic Party (PDP)
    A.  Founded by politicians from the northern conservative and
        progressive of the First and Second Republics, the eastern party
        of the Second Republic and from the Delta
        -   step towards reducing regional/ethnic tensions
        -   Obasanjo chosen to balance regional ties (from South-East)

    B.  Originally won support in the north and east; today, it wins in
        south and middle of the country (losing support in the North)

    C.  In 2011, it was the only political party in Nigeria with access
        to the resources needed to do favors for legislators, loyalists
        and voters

    -   only party able to build a clientelist machine (like PRI)

    D.  In danger of falling apart of Jonathan's potential reelection
        bid in 2015

II. The All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP)
    A.  Founded by Kanuri leaders and mid-Belt minority politicians and
        southern politicians close to Abacha
        -   includes other minorities from the north-east and the south
            and traditional Hausa-Fulani elites (Emirs)
        -   was a conservative party

    B.  In 2003 and 2007, it became a vehicle for General Buhari's
        presidential ambitions -- and for his call for a Shari'a based
        legal system
        -   12 states in the north have Shari'a based legal systems for
            Muslims

        1.  This cost the ANPP support in the South

    2.  Following the 2007 election, ANPP leaders accepted the new
        President Yar'Adua invitation to join a "coalition" government
        -   PDP did not need ANPP support (had \~65% of seats), exercise
            in political cooptation
        -   Buhari leaves the ANPP
