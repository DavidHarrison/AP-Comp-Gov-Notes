- has no real power
- is China's legislature
- has the power to check other branches
- less than 1/5 of the Congress is a industrial worker/farmer
- similar levels of women to the US Congress
- slight over representation of ethnic minorities (14% non-Han in the Congress vs. 8% in the country)
- selected by Provincial Congress
- leaders selected in overwhelming votes (generally, there is only one party candidate or line)

### President/Vice President
- largely ceremonial

## Subnational Government
- formally, there are three reports of a given position in Subnational government
    - to the next level up of government (county ministry to provincial ministry)
    - to the general government of the same level (county ministry to country government)
    - most importantly, to the Communist Party equivalent body (county ministry to county Communist body)
- government is highly centralized
- under CCP control
- Communist Party can make decision binding at all levels of government

## Fragmented Authoritarianism
An authoritarian state with dispersed power in which policy results from a complex process of bargaining, conflict and cooperation among political actors at various levels of the system.\
- The Communist party maintains control regardless of its favor with the people
- all key members of government are party members
- throughout all government, there are equivalent bodies in the Communist Party
- in every government organization, there are members in the agency reporting to the party
- often, unofficial channels must be used

### "Cadre List" System
- also called the Nomenklatura system (from USSR)
- there are millions of sensitive jobs in both government and civil industries (government, academia, media, SOEs etc.)
- before a person is hired for any of these sensitive jobs, they must first be approved by the CCP, who maintains a dosier on anyone considered a possible candidate for a sensitive position
