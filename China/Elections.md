# Elections in China
I.  Each people's congress is elected by the people's congress below it (in the same way as the party congresses)
    - More than one candidate per position is allowed in elections (by secret ballot) -- it only takes 10 members of a people's congress to nominate a deputy for election as a member of the next higher congress. Nonetheless, elections are carefully maintained by CCP officials. No one is elected to a people's congress if the CCP disapproves.

II.  Elections for Village Committees in rural villages are by secret ballot. They are direct, multi-candidate, non-partisan elections (do not have to be a CCP member).
