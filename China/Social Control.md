# Social Control

## Decaying mechanisms of social control
- Danwei (work-unit) system
    - met regularly
    - led by party member in the work group
    - self-criticism
        - needs of the individual are subservient to those of the group
        - if one did not criticize oneself, they would be criticized by others
    - reading of Marx, Lenin, Mao
        - leader documents the development of politically correct ideologies
- Residents Committees
    - same as Danwei discussion for communities
- both decayed as China became more affluent, better educated and more connected with the rest of the world

## Protest
- protest are common (1000s a year)
- government often ignores the protest, or tells the leader to make concessions
- mass protests against the regime are not tolerated
- many protests are in the countries
- no mass protests demanding democracy since 1989
