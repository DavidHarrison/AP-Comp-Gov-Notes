# Politics in China
- connections are critical
- patron-client politics are pervasive at the local level: officials exchange government-bestowed benefits (rents) in return for loyalty, political support and reciprocal favors
- resources are allocated in a personalistic and highly-discretionary manner
    - rewards tend to go to citizens who are politically loyal or support the local leader
    - gift-giving used with doctors, schools etc.

## NGOs in China
- there are many interest groups in China
- some groups do not develop because the government has already created them
- formation of mass autonomous interest groups is preempted by the existence of CCP organizations (esp. for women, labor)
    - party organization co-opts the interests into party-supported projects
    - party organizations can make demands on the system, though only in acceptable ways
- independent NGOs are tolerated so long as they do service projects or advocate changes in policy as long as they do not criticize the party or the Chinese government or CCP/Government policy
- NGOs must register with the government
- tend to work in poverty relief, healthcare, environment, legal reform (carefully)
- sometimes lawyers are sent to jail for defending clients under existing law
