        -   Truman hints at nuclear weapons
        -   China and USSR force N. Korea to accept boundaries (still
            not officially settle, never a truce) \#\# The People's
            Republic

I.  Initial Phase (1949 - 1953)
    A.  Chinese government maintains a mixed economy with only heavy
        industry owned and operated by the state
    B.  The government undertakes land reform: large estates are divided
        among landless peasants
        -   not compensated (sometimes executing landowners)
        -   agricultural output remains high

II. First Five Year Plan (1953 - 1957)
    A.  China implements a Soviet-style economic system with central
        economic planning and government ownership of most enterprises
    B.  Agriculture collectivized -- no loss of agricultural output
    C.  Mao is troubled with the bureaucratization of the government and
        growing economic inequality
        1.  He asks for public critiscism of the government ("Hundred
            Flowers Movement") (1956)
            -   sees revolution as an ongoing process to transition the
                economy and create the new Socialist man

        2.  Followed by Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957)
            -   comments from Hundred Flowers Movement were more
                critical than had been assumed
            -   end to public discussion of politics until late 1980s
                (Tienanmen Square)

III. The Great Leap Forward (1958-1960)
    1.  Attempt to develop China through decentralized production (jump
        over Capitalism and Socialism)
        -   form small work groups (no different working for corporation
            or state in big enterprise) (each group produces for itself)
        -   in order to bring about "true Communism"

    2.  The collective farms are reorganized into farming communes
        (1000s of families)
        -   best example of succesful collective is the Kibbutz, which
            has social controls to hold people accountable
        -   no social controls at large scale
        -   results in a famine: 25m - 30m people die
            -   food available in grain warehouses
            -   however, each level had its quotas, which they falsely
                reported
            -   Beijing refuses to open warehouses if output quotas are
                good

    3.  Soviet Union and China denounce each other as bad Communists -\>
        ideological rift (1962)

IV. Beginning in 1960, Mao turned over day-to-day governance to the two
    lieutenants, Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi.
    A.  Combination of state control and increased use of markets to
        allocate resources to production
        1.  Results in economic growth
        2.  Mao concerned about growth in inequality, materialism and
            elitism

    B.  Mao launches the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
        (1964-1971) -- purge characterized by hysteria, intolerance,
        score-settling, humiliation, torture, murder
        -   concerned that he is losing power to the Politburo
        -   Mao calls on the Red Guard (16 to 22 year old men) to purge
            elitists and moderates
        -   politicization of factories
        -   Deng and Liu are remove and put in reeducation camps

    C.  Mao calls out People's Liberation Army to restore order
        (1969-71)
    D.  Beginning in early '70s, Mao pursues policy of improved
        relations with US

V.  Power struggle between 1972 and 1976 culminates in Mao's death
    (1976)  and the arrest of the "Gang of Four" (including Mao's widow)

    A.  Returned to power, Deng Xiaoping reduces the role of the state
        in the economy and to increase the use of markets to allocate
        resources to production (1979)
        -   more successful than the crash liberalization of post-Soviet
            Russia
        -   results in spectacular growth throughout the 1980s

    B.  In the late '80s, the public grows frustrated by growing
        government corruption, slow pace of cultural liberalization and
        inflation; massive demonstrations out in Chinese cities (1989).
        The protestors demand political democracy.
        1.  More than 1m people demonstrate in Tienanmen Square. On 4
            June 1989, tanks clear the Square. Hundreds killed when PLA
            takes control of Beijing.
            -   opposition in government lose their positions
            -   last political demonstrations of their type in China
                -   since then, demonstrations do not challenge the
                    basis regime

        2.  Following the "June Fourth Incident" Deng cracks-down on
            dissent and pauses his economic reform efforts (1989-91).
            Deng concludes that economic stagnation was the root cause
            of the 1991 collapse of the USSR; in 1992, Deng accellerates
            economic reforms.
            -   fear that any political liberalization would lead to a
                disintegration of the People's Republic
                -   if given the choice, some regions would leave China
            -   ability of the Communist party to deliver material
                progress becomes its primary source of legitimacy

    C.  In the 1990s, Deng slowly turns his power over to his protog√©
        Jiang Zemin. By 1993, Jiang is the General Secretary of the CCP,
        President of the PRC, and Chairman of the Central Military
        Commission. He is in control when Deng dies in 1997.
        -   Jiang Zemin proves himself as mayor of Shanghai, ending
            protests with minimal loss of life in 1989
        -   will not be an all-powerful leader, head of party elected
            for up to two five year terms

        1.  Jiang pursues further economic liberalization (China joins
            the WTO in 2001) but *not* political liberalization.
        2.  In 2002-03 Jiang is succeeded by (according to Deng's
            wishes) by Hu Jintao.
            a.  Hu starts by purging some of Jiang's allies from the CCP
            b.  Hu positions himself to the left of Jiang on economic
                issues, but is even more repressive of dissent.
                -   increased power of SOEs
                -   government pays school fees for students in rural
                    areas
                    -   creates incentives for illegal migrants to send
                        children back to villages for high school
                -   begins national healthcare
                    -   allows rural residents to spend money rather
                        than saving for possible health issues
        3. In 2012-2013, Hu is succeeded by Xi Jinping. The standing Committee of the Politburo is reduced to 7 members -- 5 (incl. Xi) are allies of Jiang Zemin, while only 2 (incl. Li Keqiang, the Premier) are allies of Hu
            - Hu was not well regarded, an was immeadiately removed from power
