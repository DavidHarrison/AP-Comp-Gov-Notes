# China Since 1949
- October 1, 1949 -- Mao proclaims PRC
    - Nationalists leave to Taiwan
- November 1950 -- Chinese forces fighting against US in Korea
    - Soviets in North Korea -- Communist dictatorship
    - Americans in South Korea -- ant-Communist dictatorship
    - people generally fled south
    - Korean War
        - North sweeps south
        - UN becomes involved (Soviets boycott UN because PRC is not represented)
        - US & Allies fight under UN flag in S. Korea
        - US forces N. Koreans back into China
        - US begins to attack on Chinese side of the border
        - China counter-attacks driving US back to ~38 parallel (near where the war started)
        - stays this way for 2 years
        - Truman hints at nuclear weapons
        - China and USSR force N. Korea to accept boundaries (still not officially settle, never a truce)
## The People's Republic
I.  Initial Phase (1949 - 1953)
    A.  Chinese government maintains a mixed economy with only heavy industry owned and operated by the state
    B.  The government undertakes land reform: large estates are divided among landless peasants
        - not compensated (sometimes executing landowners)
        - agricultural output remains high
II.  First Five Year Plan (1953 - 1957)
    A.  China implements a Soviet-style economic system with central economic planning and government ownership of most enterprises
    B.  Agriculture collectivized -- no loss of agricultural output
    C.  Mao is troubled with the bureaucratization of the government and growing economic inequality
        1. He asks for public critiscism of the government ("Hundred Flowers Movement") (1956)
            - sees revolution as an ongoing process to transition the economy and create the new Socialist man
        2. Followed by Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957)
            - comments from Hundred Flowers Movement were more critical than had been assumed
            - end to public discussion of politics until late 1980s (Tianeman Square)
III. The Great Leap Forward (1958-1960)
    1. Attempt to develop China through decentralized production (jump over Capitalism and Socialism)
        - form small work groups (no different working for corporation or state in big enterprise) (each group produces for itself)
        - in order to bring about "true Communism"
    2. The collective farms are reorganized into farming communes (1000s of families)
        - best example of succesful collective is the Kibbutz, which has social controls to hold people accountable
        - no social controls at large scale
        - results in a famine: 25m - 30m people die
            - food available in grain warehouses
            - however, each level had its quotas, which they falsely reported
            - Beijing refuses to open warehouses if output quotas are good
    3. Soviet Union and China denounce each other as bad Communists -> ideological rift (1962)
