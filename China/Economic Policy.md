Chinese Economic Policy
=======================

I.  Mao's Industrial Policy
    A.  Command economy: state owns and controls most resources;
        government planners -- and *not* markets -- allocate resources
        to production
        1.  The First Five Year Plan (1953-57)
            -   Stalinist Five Year Plan

        2.  Attempt at decentralizg production -- The Great Leap Forward
            (1958-60)
        3.  Attempt at politicizing production -- The Great Proletarian
            Cultural Revolution (1964-71)

    B.  Mao's accomplisments
        1.  Established a basic industrial and technological
            infrastructure
            -   railroads, ports, mines, factories, broadcasting
                facilities

        2.  Huge strides in in public health/healthcare
        3.  Huge strides in public education, literacy

II. Deng's Reforms
    A.  Government economic planning is largely replaced by market
        allocation of resources
    B.  Economic management decentralized -- it moves from bureaucrats
        to families, enterprise managers and entrepreneurs
    C.  SOEs are forced to compete with private enterprises
    D.  The number of SOEs is reduced
        1.  Unprofitable SOEs are forced into reorganization
        2.  Partial privatization of SOEs (not successful)

    E.  Export-led growth as a development strategy: use advantage of
        low wages to produce industrial goods inexpensively and export
        them; use the foreign capital earned through export to modernize
        the economy and drive growth.
        -   does not have oil or other natural resources (like much of
            East Asia)
            -   means that it cannot become a Rentier State
        -   can lead to middle income trap

-   today claims to be a "social market economy"
    -   not entirely socialist
    -   private/semi-private produces most things
    -   some key industries are controlled by the state (oil, media,
        telecommunications, banks)
    -   not a full market economy
        -   state-owned banks are a huge part of investment
        -   does have a stock market and FDI
    -   any large business has a "leadership committee" which reports
        back to the party

III. The Chinese Countryside
    -   only became predominantly urban in the past 5 years

    A.  Maoist Farm Policy
        1.  Land reform gave way to collectivization in the early '50s
            (\~250 families)
            -   economies of scale (collective can own tractors)

        2.  Collectives gave way to communes during The Great Leap
            Forward (several thousand families)
            -   loose accountability

        3.  Output falls (resulting in famine), then recovered and kept
            up with population growth
            -   same time as a drought

    B.  Today: "Household Responsibility System"
        -   starting with Deng in the 1980s
        -   consequences are very controversial

        1.  Local governments own land: families lease land (30-year
            leases) and produce and crops their own crops
        2.  Resulted in increased output and farm incomes
            -   increased calorie consumptions
            -   popularity of dairy products growing (non-essential)

        3.  Challenges
            a.  Land tenure rights of farmers
                -   local government frequently cancel leases (with
                    minimal, non-market value, compensation)
                -   since local governments must provide services
                    without the ability to levy land taxes, they must
                    partner with businesses
                -   land seizures are the most controversial issue in
                    rural areas
                -   fear of land seizure stops farmers from investing in
                    land
                -   dispute between pragmatic and ideological factions

            b.  Pressure on birth rates (also results from "breaking of
                iron rice bowl")
                -   families want sons to help with farmwork
                -   under Mao, the "iron rice bowl" assured all citizens
                    basic services (work, housing, basic healthcare,
                    pensions)
                -   under Deng, all of these services are lost
                -   particularly the loss of pensions has increased
                    birth rate

    C.  Town and Village Enterprises (TVEs)
        -   used by local governments to pay for services

        1.  Rural businesses and factories that are owned and operated
            jointly by local governments (real resources) and private
            entrepreneurs (capital)
            -   creates a financial incentives to not enforce
                profit-limiting regulations (workplace safety etc.)

        2.  These enterprises raise their own capital and make their own
            business descisions
            -   capital can come from anywhere

        3.  TVEs manufacture goods for export (increasingly for domestic
            consumption as well) and raise capital globally
            -   during the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese government
                was forced to stimulate the domestic economy

Problems of Economic Growth
---------------------------

1.  The breaking of the "iron rice bowl" caused hardship to millions,
    especially in rural areas. In particular, health quality declined
    (esp. in rural areas)
    -   Chinese government is working on a national health insurance
        system
        -   frees up rural residents from having to save large amounts
            of money for possible health expenses, stimulating the
            economy

2.  More than 150 million people have moved from rural China to China's
    city; 100 million more people will move to China's cities in the
    next decade
    -   most are moving illegally
        -   rural migrants are a "floating pool" of easily exploited
            labor
        -   fill the role that illegal migrants in the US economy do
            (off-book working at low quality)
        -   their access to housing and education (for their children)
            is much less than the access enjoyed by legal residents

3.  Growing affluence has resulted in growing corruption
    -   "Guanxi"
    -   the family of Wen Jiabao amassed \$2.7 billion while in power
    -   from high level to low level ("gifts" to doctors, bribes of
        policemen)
    -   bureaucratic system is very personalized
    -   nepotism is rampant
    -   corruption is a significant threat to the continuation of the
        Communist system

4.  Economic growth has favored
    -   urban residents over rural residents
    -   people in eastern China over people in western China
    -   men over women

5.  Pollution
    -   most power in China is generated by coal
    -   major cities, particularly Beijing, has huge pollution problems
        -   on average, a resident of Beijing loses 5 years of their
            life to pollution
    -   China is the worlds (absolute) greenhouse gas emitter
    -   soil erosion
    -   water pollution/water scarcity
        -   Three Gorges unduly interrupts river
        -   diversion of water from Southern China to Northern China
    -   desertification
        -   results in a loss of farmland
    -   toxic waste pollution

Political Consequences of Economic Growth
-----------------------------------------

1.  Economic growth is an explicit basis of the legitimacy of China's
    political system
2.  Decentralization of the economy has empowered provincial and local
    government
3.  Growth of an educated middle class of businesspeople, engineers,
    professionals --> *could* lead to demands for increased democracy
