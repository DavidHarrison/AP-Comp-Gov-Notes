# One Child Policy
- since 1970s
- gender-selective abortion has been a problem
    - it is illegal to check the gender of the child before birth
    - in many areas, if the first child is a girl, the family is allowed to have another

- exceptions
    - rural area, first child a girl, allowed another chile
    - urban area both parents are only children
        - new rule, only one parent has to be an only child
            - up to local areas to implement
    - policy has never applied to ethnic minorities
    - penalty for having too many children is an annual fine
- has resulted in having 300-400 million fewer people in China than otherwise

## Problems
- China's work force is now shrinking
    - relatively high number of dependents
- gender gap has social implications
    - large number of males cannot expect to marry
        - possible problems of gangs, alcohol etc.
