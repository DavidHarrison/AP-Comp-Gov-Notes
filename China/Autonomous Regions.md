# China's Autonomous Regions
- Han Chinese majority nationally
    - there a many other ethnic groups, and languages
    - Mandarin is lingua franca
- concentrations of ethnic minorities in the 5 Autonomous Regions
    - Guanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, Xinjiang
    - 60% of China's land area
    - only two have non-Han majorities
        - Xinjian - Uighur
            - 40% Han, government promoted settlement
    - despite being "autonomous", have no more power than other regions

## Religion
- freedom of religion with restrictions
    - government heavily prefers the leader of the religion to be a Chinese citizen (so they can be appointed/controlled)
    - can bring the Chinese government into conflict with the West
- Falun Gong
    - treated as a cult by the Chinese government
        - similarly to Scientology by German government
        - Falun Gong organized protests when there was some restriction of Falun Gong, the government cracked down
- no real day to day interference with most major religions (Abrahamic, Hindu etc.)

- minority languages are encouraged
    - instruction is bilingual
- members of ethnic minorities are not subject to the one child policy

- governor of the region is generally a member of the ethnic minority
    - real power is not with the governor, but with the party leader (who is always Han)

- ethnic minorities, and their regions, tend to be poorer than the Han

## Tibet
- has long been a vassal state of China, though has been run intermittently by China, majority autonomous
- Chinese took over Tibet peacefully in the 1950s
- after protests in the 1960s, China sent in the PLA and took Tibet by force, forcing many to flee
- there has been violence against Han Chinese after Chinese government intervention
- the Dalai Lama's official stance is for autonomy within China, though younger Tibetans (esp. in exile) clearly want independence
- in 2008 there was a crackdown in Tibet after protests and violence against Han and the Chinese government

## Xinjiang
- PLA runs mines in Xinjiang for rare-earth metals
- sparsely populated
- for the last 10 years, there has been a violent separatist (but not terrorist) campaign, until 2009
- in 2009, a Uighur was beaten to death in a hate crime
    - arrests were made, no real prosecution
    - sense that the murders had gotten away with it
    - caused rioting in Urumqi between gangs of Uighur and Han resulting in many deaths
    - PLA called in, has patrolled since
- high-speed rail will be extended to Ürümqi
