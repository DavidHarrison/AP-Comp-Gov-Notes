China's 9 Political Parties
===========================

I.  The Chinese Communist Party
    A.  70m members (8% of adult population)
        -   world's largest political party
        -   membership is competitive
            -   career move
            -   more poeple are turned down than accepted
            -   tests on Marxist, Leninist and Maoist thought

        1.  Workers, farmers, fishermen comprise 45% of Party; most
            members are middle class
        2.  Special outreach to successful entrepreneurs
        3.  20% of Party members are women (2.5% of central committee,
            2/25 of Politburo)

    B.  70m members of Communist Youth League (ages 14-28)
    C.  Organized on Leninist (democratic centralist) lines
        - Party is made up from lower levels of regional party

II.  China's has 8 other political parties
    A.  Each party represents a different sector of Chinese society
        - e.g.
            - intellectuals
            - businessmen with ties to "Overseas Chinese"
    B.  These parties advise the CCP on policy, and and explain CCP to their sectors
    C. These parties have a combined membership of 500,000. They do *not* question or challenge the monopoly on political power enjoyed by the CCP.
    D. Every year, when the National People's Congress meets, the CCP convenes the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing
        1. The 2000 conferees are invited by the CCP to attend the Conference and give the CCP policy advise. The conferees are either members of China's 8 non-Communist parties or unaffiliated with any party
        2. The Conference is chaired by senior CCP officials
        3. The conferees attend sessions of the National People's Congress as ex-officio (can attend and talk, but not vote) members
            - suggests corporatism

## Parties
- Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang.
    - second most important (after CCP) party
    - leftist members of KMT who did not flee to Taiwan
- China Democratic League
    - intellectuals
- China Democratic National Construction Association

    - those with ties overseas Chinese
- Jiusan Society
    - intellectuals in science, tech, education, culture, medicine etc.
- Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    - those with links to Taiwan, advocating for a unified country with two systems

III.  Attempts to create other political parties or to call for an end to the CCP's monopoly on power are severely punished

## Consultative Authoritarianism
China's leaders are not accountable to the general public for their decisions by any formal process (e.g. elections). A small number of unelected people make key policy decisions; those decisions and the power of these people to make them may not be questioned.\
Nonetheless, the CCP consults with a broad range of individuals and groups when it makes national policy (using a variety of marketing techniques)\

## Deng Xiaoping Thought
- CCP is still a Marxist-Leninist party on paper
- each generation of leadership has added their own parts to the ideology
    - Marx, Lenin, Mao, Deng
- The Main task of the Chinese Communist Party is to bring about the economic development of China by any means that it can ("Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics")
- looks like state capitalism in Mexico
- today, inequality in China is higher than in the United States

## Ideology
- the Chinese Communist Party adapts to changing conditions
- The CCP does not base the legitimacy of its monopoly on political power on Marxist ideology.
- That legitimacy rest on:
    1. economic progress (*improving living standards*)
    2. nationalism (world power)

- China puts a lot of effort into controlling the internet
    - limited number of ISPs
    - crack-downs of proxy-servers
    - many Western websites are banned (Facebook, NYT, Wall Street Journal etc.)
        - forced self-censorship by search engines (Google stopped self-censoring, and moved to Hong-Kong
