The Structure of Russian Government
===================================

I.  The Constitution of 1993

    -   Approved by the people when denied by the Parliament
    -   Based on the constitution of the French Fifth Republic
        -   Itself in response to the liberal (PR, weak PM etc) French
            Fourth Republic

    A.  Establishes a powerful executive
        1.  In the 1990s, the state was not powerful relative to the
            oligarchs who were taking over the economy; accordingly, the
            executive was not powerful in practice. Since 2000 (election
            of Putin), the state has been strengthened and the executive
            has grown more powerful.
        2.  Potential for political conflict built into the constitution
            a.  President and the State Duma (lower house of Federal
                Assembly) elected seperatly -- creating the possibility
                of divided government
            b.  Constitution creates a Constitutional Court (similar
                powers to US Supreme Court), creating the possibility of
                conflict between Judiciary and the other branches of
                government
            c.  Constitution creates both a President and a PM, creating
                the possibility of conflict within the executive branch
                -   Whichever Putin holds ends up being the most
                    powerful

            d.  Russia is a federal republic -- potential conflict
                between the federal government and the 83 (consolidated
                from 89) regional governments.
                -   Variety of different distictions (levels of autonomy
                    etc.)
                -   Some regions have non-Russian majorities (Chechnya,
                    Dagestan etc.)
                    -   Muslims in Southwestern Russia
                    -   Tartars in central Russia (historically
                        relations have been good, recent problems)

                -   in the 1990s, Yeltsin negotiated different treaties
                    with each of the regions, resulting in different
                    levels of autonomy
                    -   Chechnya and Tartar republics had virtual home
                        rule
                    -   Putin reduced this power difference towards
                        lowest level of autonomy (Tartar republics still
                        have greater autonomy)

                -   Historically, Chechen fight has not been based on
                    religion, instead on nationalism, only in recent
                    years have radical Islamist groups (al Qaeda etc.)
                    made the fight religious
                -   7 federal districts made by Putin (allegedly for
                    providing federal services, actually to restore
                    power of federal governmen over the regions)

    B.  The Executive branch includes a President and a PM
        1.  The President is the head of state; the PM is the head of
            government (President is not a symbolic head of state as in
            some European countries). The President nominates the PM,
            whose nomination must be approved by the State Duma (lower
            house of the Federal Assembly)
        2.  The President oversees foreign policy, national security and
            relations with Russia's regions. The PM (on paper) oversees
            economic policy. The PM chooses the members of his candidate
            who are then formally nominated by the President. Cabinet
            members must be confirmed by the State Duma.
        3.  The PM succeeds to the Presidency on the death or
            resignation of the President (no Vice-President)
        4.  The president's term of office
            a.  1993-2012 - four year term
            b.  2012 - 6 years
            c.  No person may serve more than 2 consecutive terms (no
                life-term).

            -   Putin, when he became inelligble in 2008, he became PM,
                with his most recent PM Dmitri Medvedev, becoming
                President, after 4 years, Putin announced that he would
                run for office in 2012 (with the extended 6-year term
                passed under Medvedev)

        5.  The President has the power to govern by decree as long as
            the decree does not violate a federal law or the
            constitution. Federal Assembly can overturn the decree by
            passing a law. But, the president has veto power (subject to
            a 2/3 override vote)
            -   Essentially, gives the president the power to set law in
                emerging areas

        6.  The President's choice of PM is subject to the approval of
            the State Duma. If the Duma rejects the President's
            nomination three times consecutively, the President can
            dissolve the Duma and call for new elections (can be the
            same nominee each time)
        7.  The State Duma may remove a PM by voting "no confidence" in
            him twice in a six-month period.
        8.  The President may declare martial law or a state of
            emergency (similar to Latin America, where they were abused
            in the 1970s), in which constitutional safeguards are
            suspended, or to temporarily set aside acts of other
            branches of government (if he believes they violate federal
            law or the Constitution) -- these acts require the approval
            of the Federation Council (FC) (upper house of the Federal
            Assembly (FA)). The President has the power to issue
            pardons, and to call referenda

        -   Federation Council:
            -   Each of the region sends two representatives
            -   One of the representatives is elected by the people, one
                is appointed by the governor (from 2004-2012 nominated
                by President)
            -   Does not act as much of a brake on the President

        -   Dmitri Medvedev
            -   Friend of Putin from working in Municipal government in
                early 1990s
            -   Lawyer (same as Putin) by training

    C.  The Dual Bureaucracy of the Executive Branch
        -   Bureaucrats report either to the PM or directly to the
            president

        1.  The "power ministers" (foreign affairs, defense, FSB) report
            directly to the president
            -   Power minister head "power ministries"

        2.  President has as staff of 2000+ people who duplicate the
            work of, and often compete with, the senior personnel in
            cabinet ministries
        3.  Presidential administration and the ministerial civil
            service are riddle with patronage networks. Putin developed
            legislation in 2004 to attempt to professionalize the civil
            service (institute exams, reduce nepotism etc.) (unclear
            what progress it has made)
            -   Patrons promote the career of a bureaucrat in return for
                loyalty
            -   Common in many countries (less so in Britain and US
                because of rigorous exams)
                -   US in 19th was largely patronage (reason for strict
                    exams and tenure)

            -   Russian military is also based on patronage

        4.  State Legal Office reviews all legislation
        5.  **Security Council** (*not* created by the Russian
            Constitution)
            a.  Advises President on national security, law enforcement
                and foreign policy
                -   Russia has suffered large amount of seperatist
                    violence
                    -   Russia deals with the terrorism heavy-handedly
                        (killing hostages etc.)
                    -   Putin has used the terrorism to consolidate his
                        power

            b.  Consists of the PM, the "power ministers" and the 7
                heads of Russia's federal districts

        6.  **State Council** includes the heads of Russia's 83 regions
            -   Created to mollify governors after they were removed
                from the FC
                -   Governors, until 2004, were members of the FC
                -   Governors upset, previously they were able to live
                    in Moscow for months at government expense

    D.  The Security Service and the military
        1.  Putin has drawn many/most of his advisors, cabinet officers
            and heads of state owned enterprises (Gaz-Prom, Rosneft
            etc.) from the KGB/FSB

        -   Progression:
            -   Cheka (Lenin)
            -   NKVD (Stalin)
            -   KGB
            -   FSB (after 1991 coup)

        -   Putin's appeal based on his personal discipline (does not
            drink, stays in good shape, practices judo)
            -   Often posed as being manly in photographs
            -   Employment, sobriety highly valued by Russian culture

        -   FSB is involved in assination of journalists
            -   Polokovskia
            -   Berozovsky's security
                -   Killer was not extradited and is imune from
                    prosecution as a member of Duma

        2.  Military has declined in size, power and budget since the
            Soviet era (now not one of the 4th largest military powers)
            Putin has recently increased the military budget to
            modernize the military: reduce troop strength but invest in
            more sophisticated equipment.
            a.  Universal conscription, though people with means avoid
                military service (buy diagnosis of
                paranoid-schizoprenia)
            b.  Conscientious objection allowed

            -   large amounts of hazing in the military (severe
                beatings)
            -   possibility of being sent to a war-zone (Chechnya)
            -   One of the first to develop (and most powerful) civil
                society groups is Mother's of Servicemen

    E.  The Judiciary
        1.  Constitutional Court -- 19 memebers nominated by President
            and apporoved by Federation Council
            -   similar to US

            a.  Resolves conflicts re: individual rights and the
                consistency of regional laws with the federal
                constitution and federal law
            b.  Depends on executive to enforce decisions

            -   often judge are controlled by executive and are bribed

        2.  Supreme court -- final court of appeal for cases not raising
            constitutional issues
        3.  Special commercial courts
            -   as in many European countries
            -   generally well handled

        4.  Regional courts to decide cases involving regional law

Russian Federation
------------------

I.  Russian consists of 83 regions
    -   Some have significant autonomy
    -   Lenin gave region to Russian Jews in Eastern Siberia

    A.  In the 1990s, a system of "asymetrical federalism" developed in
        which different amounts of power were exercised by different
        regional governments
        1.  Putin has tried to equalize the amount of power exercised by
            each regional government (reduces the all to the power of
            the least) -- even today the two largely Tartar republics
            have greater autonomy than other regions
        2.  President bas the power to remove a governor or dissolve a
            regional legislature, if he finds that they have violated
            the constitution (exercising this power is subject to court
            approval)

    B.  Putin has reduced the number of regions (from 89 - 83) and has
        instituted the "power vertical" (more centralized rule)
        1.  Regions have been grouped into 7 districts. Each district
            has its own HQ, and a district head repsonsible for the
            delivery of federal services in the region (however, really
            they are there to control the region)
        2.  President appoints the district heads; they serve at his
            pleasure
        3.  The 7 district heads along with the PM, the Foreign
            Minister, the Defense Minister and the head of the FSB
            comprise the Security Council

        -   None of these things have constitutional standing C. Each
            region is governed by an elected governor and an elected
            regional legislature

        1.  Regional governors appointed from 2004 to 2012.
            -   In 2012, even though electoral fraud was evident, United
                Russia (Putin's party) did not win a majority of the
                vote and barely a majority of the seats (high threshold
                in the Duma)
            -   This resulted in protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg
            -   As a concession, Putin returned the governorship to the
                electorate though did institute policies cracking down
                on protest

        2.  Regional governors once sat in the Federation Council (upper
            house) -- now each governor appoints one member of the
            Federation Council.
            -   Change in the wake of the 2004 Beslan Crisis (governors
                should stay in their region)
            -   Now governors serve on the State Council
                -   advises the President
                -   has no real power
                -   created to appease the governors accustomed to
                    Moscow living

    C.  Putin has tried to restore equality in resources and spending
        (per capita) among Russia's regions
        -   Inequality had grown after the collapse of the Soviet Union
            and its equality programs

-   Entrepreneurship Council -- Under Yeltsin, this was an informal
    group of business men who exercised power behind the scenes. Under
    Putin, the Council has established a regular membership and meets
    regularly with the federal executive branch (President and PM) to
    discuss policy.
    -   Not a sign of corporatism

-   Putin is the most powerful person in Russia since Stalin (more power
    than Khruschev, Brezhnev etc.)
    -   Still not an absolute dictator -- limitedly accountable to
        officials, oligarchs etc.
    -   Not far from a full dictatorship

Interest Representation and Popular Participation
-------------------------------------------------

I.  The Federal Assembly
    -   In most countries, the lower (popular) house of the legislature
        is the more powerful if power is inequal
        -   Originally, Russia was designed in this way

    A.  Legislation must pass both houses to become law
        1.  Legislation subject to presidential veto
        2.  Presidential veto may be overriden by a 2/3 vote of each
            house

    B.  The State Duma (lower house)
        1.  Consists of 450 members. Initially, they were elected
            through a mixed system of FPTP and PR. Since 2007, all 450
            members have been elected by PR, on a national party-list
            system.
            -   Initially similar to Mexico

            a.  Only registered parties may nominate party lists; until
                2011 registration required having many members in many
                parts of the country
                -   total of 50,000 members, in each of 42 regions, the
                    party must have 500 members
                -   Excluded nationalist parties

            b.  Party registration now requires only 500 members
            c.  Threshold requirements for representation - As of 2011:
                -   5-6% - 1 seat
                -   6-7% - 2 seats
                -   7%+ - seats in proportion to share of vote

            1.  Reforms keep out liberal parties (increases competition
                amongst liberal parties keeping them below the
                threshold) - Only significant competitor to United
                Russia is the Communist Party
            2.  State Duma approval is needed for the president's
                nominees for PM, and head of the central bank
            3.  Duma was elected for four year terms, but starting in
                2011, the Duma is elected for a five-year term
            4.  The President can dissolve the Duma, and call for new
                elections under certain circumstances - All of this is
                established in the constitution

    C.  Federation Council
        -   166 members (tow from each region)
            -   1 appointed regional governor
            -   1 chosen by regional legislature

        -   Approves senior judges, declarations of martial law and
            states of emergency, troop deployments overseas

-   Near abroad: states USSR governed that are now independent of Russia
    -   Ukraine is heavily agricultural
    -   Russians believe Ukrainian is subset of Russian, Ukrainians
        believe it is independent
    -   Ukrainian politics have been messy since independence

-   Recent election were rigged, though United Russia and Putin still
    are popular
    -   Navalny is a nationalist (not overtly racist)
        -   Putin takes hypocritical stance against Navalny's
            nationalism
