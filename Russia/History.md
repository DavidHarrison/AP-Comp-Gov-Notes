Russian History
===============

Tsarist Russia
--------------

-   Autocracy (absolute monarchy)
    -   Duma (assembly) had only consultative powers at the will of the
        king

-   Composed of 14 Russian states that later became the USSR
-   Patrimonial state
    -   All property belonged to the state (the tsar)
    -   The tsar treated the property of the state as his personal
        property
    -   Nobles did not own land (given the right to use it)
    -   Serfdom (until 1861), workers transferred with the land
        -   Needed permission of land-owner to move, marry, engage in a
            trade

-   Russians and Ukrainians
    -   Russians maintain that Ukrainian culture is a sub-division of
        Russian culture
    -   Ukrainians maintain that Ukrainian culture is seperate from
        Russian culture

-   Tradition of communal farming in Russia
    -   No such tradition in Ukraine (where land is more arable)
    -   Has significant effects under USSR

-   Peasants in Russia lived in communal farming villages, called mir
    (мир) (means village, world, peace)
    -   Mir slowly broken up into commercial farms after 1900s)

-   Industrialization largely conducted by government
    -   Joint-stock companies with foreign investors (mostly from
        Germany or France, some Britain)
    -   Some industry owned outright by foreign banks (some German,
        largely French)

-   World War I pushes Russia to the breaking point
    -   millions of Russians died
    -   food riots in major cities

-   March 1917 (February Revolution) - Monarchy is toppled by liberal
    democrats
    -   support restrictions on state, democracy and free-market economy
    -   by June, 1917, Alexander Kerensky -- a socialist and a democrat
        -- had become leader
    -   Kerensky keeps Russia in the war (under pressure from British
        and French)

-   November 1917 (October Revolution) -- soldiers and sailors led, by
    the **Bolsheviks**, overthrow the Kerensky government.
-   Bolsheviks had divided into the Bolsheviks (Bolshe - big) and
    Mensheviks (Menshe - small)
    -   Bolsheviks support secretive, organized progress towards
        socialism
    -   Mensheviks support democracy and natural evolution towards
        socialism
    -   Dispute over which was bigger (most likely Mensheviks)
    -   Bolsheviks lead by V.I. Lenin
    -   Slogan: Land, Peace and Break

Leninist Ideology
-----------------

-   Bolshevism grew up in time of repression
    -   Lenin in exile in Germany (sent back to take Russia out of the
        war)
    -   Bolsheviks divided into cells of \~5 people with one
        representative to the next level (prevents information from
        leaking (under torture))
        -   Used in USSR, and China today

1.  Democratic Centralism -- party organized hierachically; leaders at
    each level are elected by the level below. Discussion can go up and
    down, not laterally. Discussion about a descision is permitted only
    before the descision is made at the top of the party (centralism)
    after that, no dissent is tolerated (discipline to win fight against
    government).
2.  Vanguard Pary -- intellectuals from the bourgeoisie "go over" to the
    proleteriat. Intellectuals have a "more objective" and better
    informed understanding of their society, and what needs to be done
    to bring about socialism, than anyone else; they are in the best
    position to lead the revolutionary transformation of society.
    -   Marx taught that the domination by the propertied is essential
        to history, despite institutions of democracy, property owners
        interested were respected (dictatorship of the burgoises)
        -   Capitalism takes us from feudalism to socialism
        -   Capitalists industrialize the country and create the urban
            middle class for socialist revolution

    -   Lenin lived in a Russia that had recently come out of feudalism,
        without the sufficient establisment of workers, creates Vanguard
        Party
    -   Vanguard Party from the bourgeoisie (nobles have not interest in
        socialism, workers do not have the appropriate skills and
        resources)
    -   Idea that the revolution should be lead by the bourgeoisie
        appeals to the bourgeoisie

-   In power, Lenin moves quickly to end the war with Germany
    -   Jan 1918 - Armistace with Germany and Austro-Hungary
    -   Mar 1918 - Treaty of Brest-Litovsk; Russia out of the war
    -   When Russia leaves the war, its allies are horrified
    -   In early 1918, US and Britain land troops in Northern Russia to
        supply anti-Bolsheviks groups
        -   part of bad relations between West and Russia

    -   With the second revolutionary government, the government seizes
        foreign property and refuses to honor debt of previous
        government

Civil war in Russia (1918-21)
-----------------------------

-   Reds - Communists vs. Whites - Monarchists and supporters of
    democracy

1.  Lenin institutes central economic planning ("War Communism")
    -   From German strategy in WWI
    -   Copied by allies in WWI, though not in Russia during WWI
    -   rolled back in 1921, reimposed by Stalin in late 1920s and stays
        on it until end of USSR

2.  Secret Police (Cheka) are given broad powers to discover and punish
    counter-revolutionaries
    -   Analog to secret police of the tsar
    -   Eventually become the KGB which turns into the FSB of modern
        Russia
        -   today, FSB, in large part runs the country
        -   FSB outside of the government/party system (unlike the old
            KGB)
        -   FSB corruptable with money (unlike the old KGB)

3.  Tsar and family executed
4.  Peasantry hates the war -- both armies requisition grain and
    conscribed peasants
    -   Reds eventually win with greater support of the peasantry

The New Economic Policy
-----------------------

1.  State retains ownership and control of heavy industry
2.  Private enterprise allowed in non-industrial sectors
3.  Foreign trade resumes
    -   Foreign countries wary (demand foreign cash upfront) (partial
        liberalization)

-   State controls and encourages art and culture; Russia is the center
    of the cultural avant-garde in the 1920s
    -   Some censorship, though critiscism of most things is allowed

Lenin Dies
----------

-   In 1924, settling off a power struggle:
    -   Bulcharin -
    -   Stalin - socialism in one country
    -   Trotsky - Worldwide revolution to prevent capitalist
        encirclement of Russia
    -   After 1926, Stalin consolidates power, ending the NEP and
        ordering the assasination of Trotsky in Mexico City (1940)

-   Mongolia (\~Russian protectorate) is the only other Communist
    country
-   Tomb still a popular destination

-   Organization of USSR -- Federation of Russia (itself a federation)
    and 11 other "republics" -- eventually 14 other republics (Baltic
    States in 1940).
-   USSR largely cut of from rest of world
    -   Not recognized by the West until the left takes power (1920s
        Britain, 1930s US)

Stalin (1926-1953)
------------------

I.  Institution of a totalitarian regime
    -   Georgian, not Russian (Stalin is an assumed name)

    A.  Power centralized in the hands of very few (mostly Stalin) --
        all rivals for power "liquidated"
        -   Stalin often saw his leaders as rivals and had them killed

    B.  Personalistic rule
    C.  Reliance on the secret police and the security apparatus to
        consolidate the regime and to secure Stalin's continued rule
    D.  In the 1930s, Stalin instituted a "crash" industrialization
        program and a military build-up to meet the challenge of a
        revitalized Germany (which Stalin foresaw)

    -   Industry was moved deep into Russia on the other side of the
        Ural mountains to prevent German capture of St. Petersburg and
        Moscow industrial centers (which almost happened)

II. During Stalin's tenure as General Secretary of the CPSU (Communist
    Party), 20-25 million Soviet citizens died as a result of Stalin's
    policies and purges, and 20-25 million Soviet citizens died in World
    War II.
    A.  Collectivization of Soviet agriculture (1928 on)
        1.  Expropriation, relocation and murder of the "kulaks"
            (successful peasant farmers)
            -   In the last years of the tsardom, some peasants (kulaks)
                had been able to gain land and do well for themselves.
            -   Stalin was distrusful of the kulaks (thinking they were
                anti-revolutionary Bourgeoisie)
            -   Those who were able to successfully farm in Siberia were
                killed

        2.  Collectivization of agriculture extended to Ukraine, where
            it met widespread resistance
            -   In Russia, there existed a precedent for collective
                farming, Ukraine had no such tradition
                -   Voluntary efforts at collective farming have
                    generally be successful elsewhere

            -   \~1/4 of livestock was slaughtered by Ukrainians
                prefering to eat it rather than turn it over to the
                collectives

        3.  Removal of successful farmers, and the collectivization of
            agriculture in Ukraine, resulted in lower crop yields and
            mass starvation (20-25 million starved to death)
        4.  Experience of famine results in bitterness in Ukraine leaves
            ultimately to collaboration with German occupation and
            secessionsit attitudes

    B.  One million Soviet citizens were killed in the Stalinist terror
        of the 1930s. Party officials subjected to purges and show
        trials
        -   Climax of the show trials was the confession of the accused
        -   In 1939, Stalin purged his officer core

    C.  The USSR mobilized and defeated Germany in WWII -- 20-25 million
        killed
        -   USSR was critical in the defeat of Germany
            -   Tide of the war turned in 1943 when Germans were
                prevented from crossing the Volga, dening them oil

    D.  Purges resume in the late 1940s
        -   In 1947-48 Stalin resumes show trials against groups such as
            doctors and Jews

    -   Overall 40-55 million killed under Stalin (\~1/5 population)
        -   even when in 1953 when he died, he was planning another
            round of show trials

III. Stalin's Legacy

    A. Fear, suspicion and a general unwillingness to talk about
    politics with anyone other than family members (even some caution
    taken with family members)

    B. Isolation from the West
    -   Soviet Union jams broadcast from the West
    -   Cuts of trade with the West
    -   Does not recieve any of the new technology from after the war
        (petrochemicals etc.)

    C. Political centralization -- but the Communist Party is weak
    (doesn't make policy, doesn't supervise the work of government
    bodies)
    -   Stalin had made all policy descisions
    -   In some countries (eg China), the Communist Party is responsible
        for overseeing the government with bodies within the party
        mirroring all government organizations down to the lowest level

    -   To this day, people are ambivolent towards Stalin (think he was
        extreme, but saved the country)
        -   In a recent radio program, Stalin came in 3rd (almost came
            in 1st) in a call-in program of the greatest Russian in
            history

    D. Censorship and party control of the arts - Did not like abstract
    art - All music had to be cheerful (forced Chotzokovik to apologize
    for a gloomy symphony which promoted defeatism)

    E. Inefficient, high bureacratic centralized planning of the economy
    1.  Labor deployed inefficiently and workers have high rates of
        absenteeism
        -   In a planned economy, cost efficieny is not important,
            however, a quota must be met, leading to workers being
            hoarded
            -   If workers produce anything, they are kept
            -   Workers are payed the same regardless of their
                attendance and productivity
            -   Not a problem during the war (women working for their
                loved ones on the front)

    2.  Militarized economy -- resources and talent devolted to arms
        race w/US
        -   Scientists are devoted to arms race with US (which at one
            point itself had 1/3 of scientists working in military)

    -   Russian imperialism during and after the war
        -   During the war, the expansion into the Baltic states and as
            far as Finland provides a buffer zone against Germany
        -   After the war, the buffer zone remains against any other war
            with Germany
        -   Keeps Germany divided
        -   Helps Chinese Communists win in China

    -   Stalin died in 1953, entombed with Stalin (later buried in the
        garden outside)

DeStalinzation (1953-85)
------------------------

-   Moves from a totalitarian autocracy to an authoritarian oligarch
-   Leaders are intent that no one will again have the all-powerful
    position Stalin had
-   Succession
    -   Stalin
    -   Khrushchev (never had Stalin's power, removed in 1964)
        (Ukrainian)
    -   Brezhnev

I.  Socialist Legalism: State will exercise repression in predictable
    ways consistent with the law.
    -   Dissent still disallowed
    -   Punishment still can be very cruel
        -   China even recently has sent dissentors to insane assylums,
            where they were drugged

    -   During WWI, on the Eastern front, few prisoners, mostly executed
        immeadiately (also happened in the Pacific Theater)
    -   GULAG - accronym for the organization that ran the Siberian work
        camps

II. 1956: Khrushchev secretly denounces Stalin
    -   Eisenhower sees possibility for improved relations, however,

    A.  1956, Hungarian Communist government overthrown, with a new
        neutral (leaves Warsaw Pact does not join NATO) government
        -   USSR invades, imposes a new communist government that makes
            moves towards liberalization with worker-owned businesses
            and markets
        -   Dispels US hopes for improved relations

    B.  Soviet acquiensence in the construction of the Berlin Wall
        -   Prompted by brain drain to West Berlin

    C.  Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
        -   Communists place nuclear missiles in Cuba, when US finds
            out, nuclear war looks possible until deal reached between
            Kennedy and Khruschev

    -   Khruschev pushed out in 1964

    D.  Soviet invasion of Czechasolvakia (1968)
        -   Communist party in Czechaslovakia had decided to liberalize
            with and become neutral

III. Tolerance of dissent, repect for at least some expressive rigts,
    varies after Stalin
    A.  Under Khrushchev (1956-64), less censorship
        -   Some previously censored media is published

    B.  When Brezhnev replaces Khrushchev, less tolerance and more
        censorship (except for a brief period in the 1970s when
        relations with US improve)
        -   Soviet invasion of Afghanistan increases tensions again
            -   US responds by army Mujahideen (and groups such as
                al-Qaeda)

IV. Tacit Social Contract
    -   In exchange for political compliance, population enjoys:
        -   Job security (even with bad performance, if fired, there are
            government employment agencies to prevent unemployment)
        -   Subsidized food and clothing
        -   Cheap (but pretty bad and crowded) housing
        -   Free transportation
        -   One week of vacation a year (factory sections closed,
            organized vacation trips)
        -   Free medical care (fairly primitive, good at some things
            such as basic surgery and cancer treatment, bad
            pharmaceuticals)
        -   Free recreational services (gyms etc.)
        -   Good educational system (most citizens get secondary
            education, university for those who qualify)
        -   By the mid 1970s, the weaknesses of the system were
            apparent:

    A.  Leadership out of touch with Soviet society
        -   Old (in their 80s)
        -   Not living much better than others
        -   Fairly sincere about socialism

    B.  Military spending cripples the economy, consuming resources that
        could be used for industrial modernization
        -   Reagan spends hugely, putting US into debt
        -   USSR is similar to a third world country, but has weapons

        1.  Aging industry, wasteful of resources and dirty
        2.  Virtually no economic growth, no improvements in living
            standard (after the early 1960s)
        3.  Life expectancy (starting in the late 1970s) begins to
            decline (mostly alcohol)

    C.  Workforce is alienated and frequently absent
        -   Under the Soviets, workers practiced "storming"; rushing to
            fill quotas at the end of the period (month), at the expense
            of quality, then taking time off and relaxing for the rest
            of the month

    D.  Resentment that USSR is falling further behind the West
        -   Seeing media from the West, the people realize that USSR are
            falling behind
            -   Had previously thought that US and USSR equal
                (politically both respectful of other)
            -   See that living standard is much better in West than
                USSR (poverty in US similar to middle class in USSR)

Gorbachev
---------

-   Mikael Gorbachev (youngest member of Politburo at 54) chosen to
    reform USSR
-   In 1985, Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the CPSU

I.  Instituted a Program of Radical Reform
    -   Meets Thatcher, Thatcher sees a new Russia that the West can do
        business with

    A.  Calls for a "law-governed state" in which the state (and the
        CPSU) will be subordinate to the law
        -   Long standing call (particularly since the death of Stalin)
        -   Has historical roots in call for rule of law in 1917
            Revolution and Khruschev calling for Socialist Legalism
        -   More recently, Medvedev called for rule of law during his
            presidency

    B.  Carries out electoral reform that results in competetive
        elections at the local level
    C.  Private enterprise legalized so long as it takes the form of
        sole proprietorship or a worker collective (illegal to employ
        others)
        -   Employment relationship seen as inherently exploitive
        -   Since 1926 (end of New Economic Policy), private enterprise
            has not been allowed

    D.  Encourages greater use of markets to allocate resources to
        production (**perestroika** - restructuring)
        -   Markets are (in the long term) much more efficient
            allocating resources

    E.  Encourages the development of civil society groups, eliminates
        most government secrecy (excluding security) and ends most forms
        of censorship (**glastnost** - openness)
    F.  Negotiates significant reductions in nuclear weapons with the US
        -   Relations with the US improve dramatically
        -   Some talks of entire disarmement (Reagan opposed nuclear
            weapons)

II. In 1989 and 1990 there are elections for parliaments at the Union,
    republic, and local levels - USSR Structure: - Union Level: Entirety
    of the USSR - Republic Level: Individual Republics (Russia, Georgia,
    Ukraine etc.) - Federation Level
    A.  In 1989, every communist regime in central and eastern Europe
        falls (almost all of them without bloodshed)
        -   Hungary opens borders, causing immigration to Hungary and
            out to the West (little emmigration directly from Hungary as
            it was comparitively well off)
        -   Causes Tianemen square

    B.  In 1990, Germany reunifies
        -   Under US influence (Britain and France less keen)
        -   US assures Russia that new states will not become part of
            NATO (many become NATO and EU, including former USSR Baltic
            states)

    C.  In the USSR, the elected parliaments of the republics declare
        that they are "sovereign" (not independent, but are the
        power-holding body for the their region) (look at USSR as unions
        similar to EU (not yet created) but with a military)
        1.  The Baltic states indicate their intention to secede from
            the USSR
        2.  In April 1991, Gorbachev negotiates treaty of union with 9
            of the 15 Republics -- the new union will be called the
            Commonwealth of Independent States. (It will include Russia,
            Ukraine and Belarus) (similar to EU but with military)
        3.  In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin is elected president of the
            *Russian federation* (Gorbachev still president of USSR)
        4.  The CPSU confronts a critical loss of authority

III. Following the unsuccessful coup attempt, Gorbachev returns to
    Moscow. His authority is all but gone (now with Yeltsin)
    -   Failed Coup:
        -   August 1991, Gorbachev on vacation at Black Sea,
            Vice-President, PM, head of the KGB, and defence minister
            seize power, place Gorbachev under house arrest (do not take
            Yeltsin into custody), do not want the collapse of the
            Soviet Union
        -   Causes mass protests in favor of democracy
        -   Yeltsin returns to Moscow and begins to organize opposition
            to the coup from the Russian Parliament building
        -   Army is called in by coupers to disperse protests
        -   Yeltsin orders military to not fire as the true authority
        -   Military sides with Yeltsin
        -   Coup collapses

    A.  Throughout the fall of 1991, the governments of the republics
        secede from the Soviet Union (many fall into conflict)
    B.  At the same time, government of the Russian federation takes
        control of the Soviet government ministries one at a time
        -   Russian ministries (previously subordinate) take over their
            respective Soviet ministries

    C.  Russia secedes from the USSR. Leaves the USSR without any member
        states (has government, no land)
        -   On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigns as president of the
            USSR and transfers his remaining powers to the president of
            Russia.
        -   On December 31, 1991, the USSR ceases to exist

    -   The dissolution and liberization would have seemed impossible in
        the late 1980s

The End of the USSR
-------------------

-   June 1991, Yeltsin becomes president of Russia
-   Asks parliament for permission for market reform, given it
-   Appoints himself prime minister
-   Surrounds himself with young, Western oriented ministry
-   Intends fast reform
-   Russia was much more government controlled than most Eastern
    European countries, but liberalizes much faster
    -   Since 1918 government had set prices, wages and used rationing
    -   first year prices rise 2500%, salaries do not keep up
    -   Yeltsin's vice-president denounces program as economic suicide
    -   Privitization entailed incredible amounts of corruption

Russia's Transistion to Capitalism
----------------------------------

-   only minor and recent market reforms in Russia
-   Eastern Europe had started to reform more and earlier than Russia
-   Russia follows "shock therapy", fast transition to a market based
    economy
-   Poland moved similarly, though reforms were unpopular and slowed
-   East Germany also moved fast, but was cushioned by influx of money
    from West Germany

I.  In 1991, Yeltsin asked Parliament for the power to carry out a plan
    of radical market oriented reform by decree; Parliament gives him
    that power
    A.  On 2 January, 1992, prices are decontrolled (for the first time
        since the 1920s); they immeadiately skyrocket (prices were kept
        artificially low by Soviet Union, sometimes below the cost of
        production, rationing was introduced to control)
        -   Prices up 2500% first year, 840% second year
        -   Wages cannot possibly keep up
        -   Yeltsin's vice president outraged; after a few months
            denounces the program as econimic suicide

    B.  To respond to skyrocketing inflation, Yeltsin asks Parliament
        for even greater powers to carry out reforms; Parliament refuses
        -   March 1993, Parliament almost impeaches Yeltsin

    C.  In Sept. 1993, Yeltsin dissolves Parliament and calls for new
        elections (his right under Russian law)
        -   Members of Parliament refuse to leave the building. At first
            Yeltsin ignores them. When armed paramilitary groups appear
            outside the building, attack the office of the mayor and
            talk about "seizing the Kremlin", Yeltsin orders the army to
            breakup the demonstrators.

    D.  In Dec. 1993, Russian voters elect new Parliament and approve
        Yeltsin's proposed new constitution.
        -   This is the modern constitution, gives large amounts of
            power to the President
        -   Millions ruined by inflation and unemployment
        -   Contrast to the Soviet system which guaranteed employment
            and social services
        -   A few took advantage of the oppurtunities to
            entrepreneurship, and a very few gained control becoming
            fabulously wealthy
        -   Resentment of this division developed, in part explains
            Putin's ongoing popularity
            -   Also Putin does not drink alcohol (source of
                credibility)

II. During the Yeltsin years, most people were worse off economically
    than they were under Communism while a few people became wealthy.
    A.  Stabilization (structural adjustment or "shock therapy")
        1.  Cuts in state spending (takes money out of the economy to
            "cool" it off)
            -   in large part military, though also in other areas

        2.  Increases in taxes (takes money out of the economy to "cool"
            it off)
            -   enrages population already struggling to deal with
                inflation

        3.  End to protectionism
            -   lower tariffs/trade barriers

    B.  Stabilization unpopular with ordinary people (hit with higher
        prices, cuts in services and end higher taxes) and with
        businesses owners who aquire businesses in the first round of
        privitization.
        -   Destroys economic projections of owners of inefficient
            Soviet businesses

    C.  The fall in real wages that takes place is expected to create
        jobs (at lower pay). Instead, consumer demand collapses --
        leading to falling production and widespread unemployment. -
        When real wages collapse, people stop buying, reducing demand,
        giving no incentive to increase production
    D.  The Russian government, faced with falling tax revenues, borrows
        money from the IMF. The IMF insists on further cuts in spending
        and further tax increases. This leads to more unemployment. -
        IMF is a last resort for countries (Recently, Greece and Spain
        have gotten IMF loans, Britain in 1970s)
    E.  Widespread privation and hunger (first time since the end of
        WWII)
    F.  Output per person (productivity) does not increase. Most
        businesses don't have the funds to invest in new equipment; the
        few solvent businesses have state contracts.

III. Privitization
    -   Privitization program leads to widespread corruption and the
        transfer of state-owned assets to a few corrupt people

    A.  First round: privitization of small and medium enterprises
        (mostly consumer goods)
        -   goes well at first
        -   fairly clean

        1.  Every Russian citizen gets a voucher worth \~\$30, which
            they could keep or sell
        2.  Vouchers could be used to buy shares in a government-owned
            enterprise that was being privatized

        -   Vouchers are not particularly worthwile, shares do not
            confer voting rights, do not necessarily have right to
            collect dividends

        3.  140 million vouchers out of 148 million issued are exchanged
            for shares, and 40 million Russians become shareholders in a
            privatized business (suggest a large amount of vouchers were
            sold)

    B.  Second round: government auctions shares in enterprises with
        natural resources assets (oil, minerals, metallurgy, timber)
        -   these are the valuable enterprises
        -   government need money from auctions
        -   less clean
        -   At the end of the Soviet Union, the people running the
            government owned banks, the senior leadership leaves, and
            young people take over (30s - early 40s, not interested in
            Communism)
            -   These people lend themselves and their family members
                the money necessary to buy the banks
            -   They use this control of the banks to buy the newly
                privatized enterprises
            -   Very few people involved in bidding (\~dozen)
            -   These people collude to rig auctions to keep prices low
                while keeping them looking honest

        1.  Banks controlled by Russia's welathiest men obtained
            controlling shares in Russia's most lucrative enterprises
            (oil, mining, metallurgy, timber) at bargain prices
            ("oligarchs")
            -   Natural gas never privatized

    C.  Third round: "loans for shares" scheme (1996)
        -   equally corrupt to the second round

        1.  The government auctions off controlling shares in some of
            the government's most lucrative enterprises in return for
            loans to the government.
            -   auctions are again rigged

        2.  When the government is unable to pay of the loans, these
            shares plegded as collatoral go to the lenders
        3.  Small number of oligarchs (friends of Yeltsin) takes control
            of the most profitable enterprises in Russia.
            -   Oligarchs not interested in running the enterprises
            -   Interested in controlling the assets and lease or sell
                the assets
            -   Move the money from these sales to foreign countries
            -   Live large amounts of the year outside of Russia

    D.  By 1996, 90% of Russian output is produced by privately owned
        enterprises
        1.  Most small and medium sized businesses that produce consumer
            products ended up in the hands of their Soviet-era managers
            (only people interested and with the expertise to run them)
            ("insider privitization").
            -   limits the number of people fired (managers less likely
                to fire people they know)

        2.  Most firms are dependent on government loans or contracts to
            survive

    E.  Widespread investor fraud is rampant (Russian law enforcement is
        not set up to deal with white-collar crime, similar to US
        derivatives fraud)
    F.  Privitization in Russia is a disaster because - China has learnt
        from Russian privitization (procedes slowly)
        1.  It takes place before Russia is really a market economy
        2.  It takes place before the state is able to regulate
            financial markets

    G.  Privitization did **not** lead to efficiency gains or
        investement in equipment that would increase worker
        productivity.
        1.  Most small and medium sized companies lacked the funds (or
            even the collatoral) to modernize
        2.  The oligarchs who owned assets/resource rich firms were only
            interested in "stripping" assets
        3.  Most firms broke, cannot pay taxes or wages on the time (50%
            of output sold by barter in 1998).

IV. The Russian government falls deeply into debt, borrowing more and
    more at every higher rates of interest
    1.  August 1998, the ruble collapses (losing 2/3 of value); Russia
        defaults on debts
    2.  Living standards fall, unemployment hits 13%, widespread hunger
    3.  Collapse of ruble helps Russian producers -- Russians only made
        Russian-made goods because imports are too expensive -- Russian
        exports now cheaper and more likely to be purchased.

V.  Recovery begins in 1999

    A.  Recovery is due almost entirely to an increase in the global
        price of oil and natural gas

    B.  Recover does **not** result from industrialial modernization
        (does not happen to a large extent)
        1.  No investment in new plant or equipment
        2.  No change in banking or industrial management

    -   In 1999, Yeltsin retires, Putin becomes president, wins
        presidency in his own right in 2000

    C.  Unemployment has fallen since 1999 (to \~7-8%) poverty has
        decline (20% of population) - Most of the real poverty in is
        small cities and rural areas (where industry has collapsed or
        young people have moved to cities)

    D.  Putin wants economic diversification and investment in
        modernization but his political policies get in the way
        1.  The imprisonment of Khordorkovsky and the seizure of the oil
            assets of Yukos, has chilled entrepreneurship
            -   After the wave of privitizaions, Mikail Khordorkovsky,
                owner of Yukos oil. Khordorkovsky may have gotten his
                wealth in disreputable ways (possibly having people
                killed)
            -   Oligarchs who have stayed with the state have kept their
                money and freedom
            -   Khordorkovsky supported liberal policies (economic and
                civil rights)
            -   Khordorkovsky was arrested, convicted of tax fraud and
                sent to Siberian labor camp. After five years, when he
                was about to be released, he was again charged with
                embezlement, and Yukos was presented with tax bill it
                could not afford, absorbed by the government.

        2.  The imprisonment and death of Sergei Magnitsky & the
            treatement of Hermitage capital has scared off foreign
            investment.
            -   American man, son of leading American communist, started
                investment firm to invest in Russia after the collapse
                of the Soviet Union (Hermitage Capital)
            -   Hermitage Capital ran afoul of Putin, and was charged
                with tax evasion
            -   Hermitage Capital lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky, arrested and
                died in Russian prison
            -   American Senate passed law denying visas to a list of
                Russians believed to be involved
            -   In retaliation the Russian government prevents the
                adoption of Russian children by Americans. Scared off
                foreign investors.

        -   These things have prevented the influx of capital needed to
            modernize Russia

-   Living standards in Russia have recovered since the 1990s

-   Recently, the FSB (KGB) has gained large amount of power
    -   Not as under control of government/party as KGB was
    -   More financially corrupt than the KGB
    -   Putin surrounds himself with FSB (former KGB himself)
