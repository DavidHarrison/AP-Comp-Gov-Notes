-   Domination of Mexican economy by foreign capitalists (mostly from
    US)
-   government paid of by foreign capitalists

Mexican Revolution
------------------

-   1910
-   First social revolution of 20th century
    -   first worker/peasant revolution

-   lead by Francisco Madero leads revolt of middle-class reformers
    **not** anti-capitalist (initially)
-   revolt of middle-class and upper-class Mexicans who want economic
    opportunities for themselves and not for foreigners
-   later questioned system peasantry (land reform)
    -   land reform is common theme

-   As the revolution progresses, more radical leaders appear:
    -   Emiliano Zapata (leads army of landless peasants)
    -   Franscico (Pancho) Villa (leads army of small holders and
        landless ranch ahnds in northern Mexico)
        -   Attack US
        -   US never find Villa

-   Authority of central government has collapsed
    -   divides up into geographical areas controlled by strongmen with
        armies
        -   sometimes revolutionaries (Zapata, Villa)
        -   sometimes land owners
        -   called cardillos (local political/military leaders)

    -   great challenge of 1920s is reestablishing central government
        rule
        -   done well
        -   not violent
        -   reffered to as "perfect dictatorship"

-   1917 - Adoption of Mexican Constitution
    -   still in effect (amended significantly)

-   one party (PRI) dominated 1920s - 1990s
-   1990s electoral system amended to stop one party from gaining 2/3
    majority needed to amend the constitution

Constitution
------------

-   state control of natural resources
-   subordination of the Church to the State
    -   forbidden to preach politics
    -   historical role had been to maintain social order, promising
        that suffering would lead to heaven

-   government has the right to seize and redistribute land
-   guarantees for workers (workplace protection) and for unions (to
    organize and strike) (most radical provisions not implemented until
    1930s)
-   no reelection for office-holders to the same office
-   1920s - Mexican revolution ends
    -   federal government attempts to co-opt cardillos (to bring them
        under federal control by offering them continued local power and
        a share of federal power and revenues)
    -   Catholic church suspends the giving of sacrament
        -   Cristero Rebellion - millions of Catholic peasants rebel
            agains the federal government (100,000 killed)

-   1924 - 1928 Plutarco Eliás Calles president (the "Jefe Maximo" from
    1928-34)
    -   persuades local leaders to accept federal support and share of
        federal power in return for not fighting the federal government
        or each other
    -   creates what is now called the "Partido Revolutionario
        Institutional" (PRI) to bind the local leaders together

-   1934 - 1940 Presidency of Lázero Cárdenas
    -   one of the only Mexican leaders to be serious about
        redistributing power to the peasants
    -   mobilizes peasants and workers in support of revolutionary
        regime: (sees itself as something of a democratic USSR)
        -   workers encouraged to strike; employers prodded to settle on
            terms favorable to the workers
        -   land reform implemented - collectives (fairly successful)
            large estates broken up and land redistributed to peasant
            farming collectives called ejidos
        -   oil industry is nationalized (PEMEX)
            -   cash-cow of Mexican government
            -   lacks profits to invest in more difficult drilling (deap
                sea etc)
            -   joint-drilling opposed on socialist and nationalist
                grounds

        -   government creates local and national organizations for
            industrial workers and ejiditarios (later opene to all
            peasants ("campazinos") and affiliates of these
            organizations with the PRI. (Initially to allow voice of the
            campazinos to be heard): creates and arms ejiditario
            militias to fight land owner's forces.

-   Emergence of the features of the on-party regime from the 1940s to
    the 1990s
    -   Labor and peasant unions are not autonomous; depend on the
        federal government for resources and organization (association
        of unions with the PRI beomces a way to control the workers
        through co-option of the labor leaders)
    -   Presidentialismo: a strong president with sweeping powers (on
        paper, Mexican govt. looks similar to US system, but PRI has
        constant majority) who serves a single six-year term ("sexenio")
    -   PRI dispenses favors to workers, peasants and their leaders
        through the worker and peasant organizations in return for
        support of the federal government
    -   PRI tries to bring in white-collar workers
    -   Corporatism: oranizations represent sectors of the economy
        (industrial workers, peasants, white-collar workers, business
        etc.)
        -   groups negotiate with gobernmenn tfor things such as wage
            increases

    -   Mexico does not have true corporatism
        -   groups are not presentative of their members (organized
            top-down)
        -   state corporatism

Rapid Economic Development in Mexico: 1940 - 1982
-------------------------------------------------

I.  Run by the PRI
    A.  The PRI provided worker and peasant organizations with the cash,
        jobs, contracts, land and oppurtunities for graft in return for
        political support.
    B.  The entire political system is built on favors -- PRI exchange
        cash, jobs, contracts, land and food to leaders of organizations
        and to ordinary people at all levels in return for support
        -   non-violent cooption
        -   marginalize protestors
        -   patron-client relations ("clientelism")

    C.  Corruption is rampant: people and businesses who supply goods
        and services to the government "kick-back" part of their
        earnings to the PRI
    D.  Party controls most interest groups and channels their
        activities (resulting in state corporatism)

II. State encourages industrialization and the accumulation of wealth
    (and inequality) (in order to create the investment capital needed
    to fuel growth)
    A.  State capitalism -- government promotes private investment and
        minimizes risk to entrepreneurs
    B.  Shift in development strategy from agro-export model of
        development to import-substitution industrialization (ISI)
        (replacing imported foreign goods with domestically manufactured
        ones)
        -   Mexico felt it was on the wrong side of imperialism (selling
            raw materials to industrialized countries to make the
            foreign capital needed to buy goods from those countries
            (agro-export))

        1.  tax incentives for investors
        2.  low rates of inflation (assured by low wage increases)
        3.  government subsidies for industrial workers (not for
            peasants/slums)
            a.  workers get low cost transport, food, housing and
                medical care from the govt.
            b.  this allows businesses to pay low wages and earn high
                profits

        4.  high tariffs (keeps out foreing competition)
        5.  government establishes state-owned power plants, oil
            refineries, steel mills and cement factories, these sell
            their goods/services to businesses at low-cost to businesses

        -   idea to let businesses be profitable so they put money back
            into the economy

    C.  Strategy is successful: living standards rise (unevenly), Mexico
        urbanizes, and Mexican industry grows more sophisticated -
        Maquiladoras: plants on the US borders (usually US or Japanese
        businesses) producing mostly electronic goods for export to the
        US (duty-free)
    D.  Shift in agricultural policy: government begins to favor
        large-scale comercial rather than subsistence growers
        1.  Mexican govt. build irrigation projects, paved roads and
            crop storage facilities
        2.  Agricultural extension services (research and education in
            agriculture)
        3.  Allows importation of farm machinery
        4.  More areas brought under cultivation
            -   during Green Revolution (new crops have greater yields)
            -   Problems: - require petro-chemicals - costly when oil
                costs rise - bad for the environment - depletes ground
                water

    E.  Organized labor is controlled through the PRI
        1.  Strikes are legally restricted
        2.  Labor leaders have access to political leaders and benefit
            personally by being able to distribute cash, jobs, food,
            contracts, apartements etc.
            -   take for granted to be corrupt by population

        3.  Mexican industrial workers are relatively well of resulting
            in labor peace

    -   Birth rates affected by:
        1.  Urbanization: on a farm, children are productive, in urban
            areas children are a dead loss
        2.  Female literacy: literate women have higher sense of
            self-worth

    F.  By the late 1960s, the problems with state capitalism and ISI
        become apparent
        1.  Growth in urban poverty; growth in urban informal sector
        2.  High tariffs and govt. subsidies make Mexican industry
            innefficient
        3.  Cost of providing workers with food, housing, transport and
            medical care proving ruinous to the state (Mexico has very
            low taxes and high levels of tax evasion)
        4.  Importing technology for industry is expensive
        5.  Inequality is growing as non-union workers and ejidatarios
            are left behind

        -   1968: In the wake of protests around the world and before
            the Mexico-hosted Olympics: Tlaltelolco Plaza Massacre (200
            killed) those students who survive are co-opted by the
            government

    G.  Rising oil prices and increased oil production in the Gulf of
        Mexico rescue the Mexican economy

    1.  Mexico imports food b/c food production lags behind population
        growth
    2.  Government spends heavily on infrastructure projects and the
        economy grows quickly
        -   most of leaders are US economics/business educated Mexicans
        -   decide that oil revenues should be used to industrialize the
            economy so that it is not dependent on oil

    3.  Mexican government borrows heavily against oil earnings to
        further industrialize economy

    -   In the 1980s the Saudia Arabian countries under the threat of
        the West moving away from oil dependence, sell more oil to bring
        prices down and keep oil competitive
        -   when oil prices fall, the government is unable to pay its
            debts
            a.  Peso devalued, wiping out savings
            b.  1983 - GDP falls by 4.6%; unemployment soars
            c.  wages and pensions lose 40-50% of their value
            d.  govt. cuts spending on poverty relief, health care and
                education

Mexico and Neo-Liberal Development (continuing)
-----------------------------------------------

I.  Economic crisis weakens the ability of interest groups to make
    demands on the state
    A.  Labor unions weakened by high unemployment (less security in
        striking)
    B.  Business groups weakened by bankruptcy

II. Other interest groups, independent of the PRI, begin to emerge
    A.  Middle-class led groups address the victims of the economic
        crisis
    B.  Earthquake in Mexico City, government's response is inadequate,
        so private groups develop to assist earthquake victims

III. 1988 Election
    -   Outgoing President of PRI picks next candidate (who will almost
        certainly become President)
    -   Carlos Salinas (PRI) vs. Cuauhtémoc Cardenas (PRD)
        (anti-neo-liberal son of Lazero Cardenas)
        -   election is close
        -   Salinas wins 50.7% of the vote; fraud is evident (mysterious
            power outage)

IV. Salinas Administration (1988-1994) pursues economic liberalization
    as a solution to the crisis
    -   period of global consensus on neo-liberalism
    -   deregulation, even though it may lead to greater inequality, is
        hoped to improve the standard of everyone

    A.  Privitization of State-Owned Enterprises (not PEMEX)
        -   private enterprises will be forced to compete and be more
            efficient
        -   raises money

    B.  Deregulation of business and finance
        -   previously much more regulated than US

    C.  Ejidos are free to divide up land and to sell land (optional)
    D.  Decentralization of responsibility for education and health to
        the states
        -   states historically weak
        -   allows reduction in funds without federal responsibility
        -   decentralizes public controversy

    E.  Liberalization of trade barriers
        -   historically high tariffs to protect Mexican industry
        -   1993 - Mexico joins NAFTA (reduction in tariffs between US,
            Mexico and Canada)
            -   expected to reduce immigration to US, in fact increases
                immigration
                -   US corn is heavily subsidized
                -   Mexican corn producers cannot compete
                -   forces increased immigration of corn farmers to US

        -   1995 - Mexico joins WTO (successor to GATT)
            -   against tariffs

        -   comparitive advantage theory
        -   political (trading countries do not war)
        -   some countries still protect local industry (US corn etc.)
        -   surrender of sovereignty
        -   international court of arbitration
            -   many conflicts between US and China

        -   Mexico has the most free trade agreements in the world
        -   setup to be relatively high sophistication, moderate wage
            industrial power

V.  1994 - A difficult year
    A.  EZLN seizes four villages in Chiapas (poorest and most
        indigineous state) (1 Jan)
        -   political show, demand better standards for Chiapas
        -   surpressed by the government
        -   ideas of new revolution

    B.  Colosio, the PRI candidate for president, assasinated in Tijuana
        (23 March)
    C.  Alarmed by political violence and greatful for what appears to
        be economic recovery, Mexican voters elected PRI candidate,
        Ernesto Zedillo, president. Within months of the election, the
        economy tanks
        1.  peso loses half of its value against the dollar
        2.  GDP falls by 6.2%
        3.  wages frozen; prices and taxes rise
        4.  US government and banks lend Mexican government \$50 billion
            (has since been paid back)

    -   weak peso encourages FDI and decreased import

    D.  The Mexican public, convinced that the PRI manipulated the
        economy to secure reelection, demands reform, Zedillo complies
        1.  Creation of the Federal Electoral Institure (FDI) (neutral
            body) to run elections
        2.  Creation of a secure (picture, eventually biometrics) voter
            ID card (primary ID in country)
        3.  Adoption of a mixed FPTP/PR electoral system (to prevent one
            party from having the 2/3 majority in congress necessary to
            make constitutional change)
        4.  Mexican political parties begin to hold party primaries with
            members voting (makes parties more accountable to voters)
        5.  Public Financing of Political Campaigns
            -   limitations of private fundraising
            -   free air-time to major parties
            -   news reporting does stay one-sided

        -   parties required to make 1/3 of their candidates women

    E.  In 1997, the PRI lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies
        (lower house, 3 year term), in 2000, Vicente Fox of the
        right-wing Partido Acción National (PAN) is elected president.

Mexico Since 2000
-----------------

-   Vicente Fox has not grown through the party (wealthy executive in
    Coca-Cola)
    -   only joined the PAN when he ran for governor
    -   liberal wing of the party (wife is a feminist)

-   PAN supports
    -   clean elections
    -   less business regulation
    -   decentralization
    -   less restriction of the church

I.  Vicente Fox in Office (2000-2006)
    A.  Moderate, pro-business pragmatist (gets on well with George
        Bush); not especially effective because he must negotiate
        support for his policies with PAN Deputies and Senators
        (distrustful of his oppurtunistic joining of party) and also
        with PRI Deputies and Senators.
        -   Presidents relations begin to be more similar to US (case by
            case negotiations)

    B.  Expands conditional cash transfer program - Oportunidades
        (Zedillo program from late 1990s)
        -   traditionally welfare programs were divided
        -   Mexico gives cash (swipe-card) to be used where they need it
            (does not make inneficient subsidies)
            -   conditional on: - parents taking children to the doctor
                -   children must be in school to 15 (if student misses
                    too many days, family does not recieve payment)
                    (2002)
                -   Brazil copies program as Bolsa Famìlia
                -   Other places looking at system: New York, Iran,
                    Nigeria

II. Felipe Calderón (PAN) v. Andrés Manuel López Obrador (PRD) (PRI
    distant third) - 2006 Election
    -   initial count Calderón 1/3% of vote
    -   Obrador demands recount by IFE because of marked ballots found
        in trash; IFE decides Calderón has still one after extrapolated
        9% recount
    -   Obrador leads protest during and after recount (mass disruption)
        (Obrador claims to have won to this day)
    -   1/3 of Mexicans believe that the election was stolen
    -   Calderón's inauguration amid protest by PRD
    -   Obrador mirrors Calderón's actions, claiming that he is the real
        president

III. Calderón in Office (2006-2012)
    -   son of PAN founder
    -   conservative (upset by Mexico City's legalization of gay
        marriage and particularly abortion)

    A.  Not effective in remove reform legislation through congress
        (PEMEX joint-venture proposed by Caldéron) -- must depend on PAN
        and PRI members of Congress for support. Late in his term
        Calderón secures a key reform -- labor market liberalization
        (removal of formal sector job security in hopes to decrease
        informal sector) (daily minimum wage to promote full-time
        labour, though not 8x previous hourly wage).

    -   Despite being on opposite sides of the political spectrum, PAN
        and PRD sometimes join forces to field candidates to defeat PRI

    B.  The War on Drugs
        -   police were widely considered corrupt
        -   war on drugs passed to the military
        -   some states (Sinaloa), were run almost entirely by the
            cartels
        -   so far 60,000 killed in the "war"
        -   Mexico is most dangerous place to be a journalist (cartels
            demand that drug war not be reported on)
        -   if gangs taken out from the top down, lieutenants will fight
        -   Peña Nieto proposed focusing on violence, rather than drug
            trafficing)
            -   code in Mexico for going to old system with gangs
                operating but not involved in politics/governance
                (Columbian system), while drugs are still trafficed at a
                the same levels
            -   large part of Nieto election
            -   possesion of drugs for personal use now legal
            -   clean house of police with extensive background checks
                (possibly flawed (eg Mexico City))

IV. Enrique Peña Nieto
    -   handsome, telegenic etc.
    -   runs mostly against Obrador (drug war leaves PAN in distant
        third)

Peña Nieto and the Pact for Mexico
----------------------------------

I.  Education reform
    -   Made hiring of teachers resposbility of federal government
        -   unions used to sell positions
        -   positions inherited
