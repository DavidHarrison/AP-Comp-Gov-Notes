# Mexico's Political Parties

## 1. Partido Revolucinario Institucional (PRI)
	- Colors: Red, White, Green (same as Mexico's national colors)
	- for most of the 20th century, the PRI
		- was a highly centralized party
		- tied to sector organizations that responded to elite dictates and **not** member interests
		- had constituency organizations in every village and neighborhood
		- distributed jobs, contracts, food, land, and services to activists able to deliver the vote at the local level
		- enjoyed a base of support among small land owners, small farmers and ejiditarios (this has declined with urbanization)
	- not ideological
		- has changed policies significanly over the years (socialism in the 1930s and 1940s to free markets in 1980s)
	- PRI dominance with urbanization and when a better-educated electorate becomes impatient for fair elections and honest government
		- follows Marxist model of democratization
	PRI reforms in the 1990s:
		- individual membership (not through sector group)
		- reorganized geographically (rather than by sector)
		- primaries to choose candidates in some places (Peña Nieto chosen through primary)
	- base of the party today is rural south and central Mexico where the machine has never died

## 2. Partido Acción Nacional (PAN)
	- accronym means bread
	- Colors: Blue, White
	- non-ideological
		- Center Right
		- ~Christian Democrat

	- founded in 1939 (during radicalism of Cárdenas sexenio) in opposition to the centralism and the anti-clerical policies of the PRI
	- Base is the urban middle class in northern Mexico
	- supports more regional autonomy and more power to the states, less government intervention in the economy, less government regulation of business, fair elections, reconciliation with the Church and support for Catholic education
	- breakthrough came in 1989 when PAN won the governorship in Baja del Norte

## 3. Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD)
	- Colors: Yellow
	- founded in 1980s by Cuahtémoc Cárdenas when he was thrown out of th PRI for advocating politcal reform and social justice)
	- Cárdenas probably won more votes than Salinas (PRI) in the 1988 election; whether López Obrador (AMLO) won more votes in 2006 than Calderón open to question (looked politically weak when he continued to claim to be the legitimate president)

		- old guard

			- focused on advancement
			- supported Marcelo Ebrard
	- Base of support is disaffected PRI supporters (industrial workers unhappy w/ their union; ejidatarios in danger of losing their land)
		- not well established nationally: its base is urban central Mexico (especially Mexico City); it functions as an opposition party to the PRI in southern Mexico (where the PAN is not well established)
	- never articulated an alternative to export-led, neo-liberal development
		- criticizes neo-liberalism of PRI and PAN
