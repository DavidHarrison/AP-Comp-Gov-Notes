# Challenges Facing Mexico

1. Emigration and Immigration
	- 10% of people alive born in Mexico live in US
	- Many would be very valuable to Mexico
		- Young
		- Risk taking
	- Now, there are more people moving from US to Mexico than Mexico to US
		- Immigrants returning
		- Europeans looking for better economy
		- Retired Americans
	- Immigrants from southern Central America into Mexico (some on the way to US)

2. Drug Cartels and National Sovereignty
	- A few main cartels (Zetas)
	- Violent
		- Some Northern cities turned into battle zones
	- Existed 1970s-90s, only became particularly violent after they were
	- If leaders are killed first, only creates more violence among lower ranks
	- Fueled by the US
		- US is the consumer
		- Guns come from Texas
	- Mexico has legalized limited personal possession of most drugs
	- Pe√±a Nieto shifted focus to violence (code for return to 1980s/90s when cartels stayed out of politics)
		- Similar to Columbia
			- less violent, no less drug trafficing
	- Drug cartels started when Florida trafficing route was shutdown, and route shifted to through Mexico
	- Challenge to sovereignty
	- Cartels threaten citizens and press to not respond to or report on violence

3. Consolidation of Democracy
	- Complaints may cause retribution occassionaly
	- All parties offer economic incentives (most in southern Mexico)

4. Economic Diversification and the Middle Income Trap
	- lost competitive advantage to countries such in Central America and Southeast Asia
	- large advantage bordering US, however, shipping has been cheap
	- China has lost its wage advantage
	- Mexico is getting jobs back from China as Chinese wages and shipping costs rise
	- Japan and South Korea avoided this by using high sophistication manufacturing
		- Few well-trained workers
		- South Korea has some of the world's best education
		- US has reasonable literacy, not numeracy
		- Investing in education
