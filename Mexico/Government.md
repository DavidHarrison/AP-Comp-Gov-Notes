The Structure of Mexican Government
===================================

-   Like other Latin American countries, is similar to the US

I.  Federalism

    A.  31 states and Distrito Federal (with powers equivalent to a
        state)
        1.  Each state has a governor and a unicameral state legislature
        2.  Each state(except Distrito Federal) is divided into
            municipos (size of city/county)
            a.  Each municipo is governed by a ayuntamiento (council)
                headed by a presidente (mayor)

    B.  In practice, Mexico governed from the center until the 1990s
        (political centralism)
        -   \~80% of expenditures are at a federal level
        -   Most of taxes collected a federal level

        1.  Federal governmet provides most money spent by state and
            local governments
        2.  In the 1990s, federal government began to move
            responsibility for providing education and health care to
            the states
            -   allows federal government to defer blaim of spending
                cuts
            -   The state and local governments resisted these
                initiatives as they entailed resolving competing demands
                for limited public funds
            -   Northern states historically are wealthier, more
                independent from the federal government and have better
                run and more extensive services
                -   True under PRI and now

    C.  First non-PRI governor elected in Baja California del Norte in
        1989

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

II. The President

    A.  Elected to a six-year term (sexenio); may not be reelected

    B.  Traditionally a powerful position (presidentialismo) -- when the
        PRI held the presidency and 2/3 of the seats in Congress, the
        president determined policy.
        1.  Today, no one party has a majority in either house of
            Congress and the President can be from a different party
            than the largest party inCongress. The president today is
            much weaker.

    C.  President can veto legislation -- subject to a veto override
        (2/3 vote required in both houses)
        -   Senate not involved in budget, is not needed to override
            budget veto

    D.  The President appoints the Cabinet
        1.  Initially under the PRI, the Cabinet consisted of senior PRI
            leaders from around Mexico (politicos). Beginning in the
            1960s and 70s, technically sophisticated men (PhDs/MBAs from
            US) (technicos) replaced the politicos.
        2.  Fox and Cal√©ron gave cabinet positions to a lot of
            apolitical technocrats and business people; they also left a
            lot of PRI appointees in place at sub-cabinet level
            positions (particularly Fox).
            -   weakens presidential control over bureaucracy
            -   did not have party insiders to please from previous
                governments (particularly Fox)

        3.  President heads a vast bureaucracy
            a.  1.5 million federal employees (US has \~2 million with
                3x the population)
            b.  1.0 million employees of semi-autonomous agencies and
                state-owned enterprises (US has \~600,000)
            c.  1.5 million employees of state and local government
                (mostly teachers)

III. Congress
    -   Bicameral
    -   System designed to prevent any one party from having the 2/3
        majority needed to change the constitution.

    A.  The Senate (upper house) consists of 128 Senators. They serve
        six-year terms (all same period as the president)
        1.  Each state (including DF) elects 3 senators (first place
            wins 2 seats; the second-place party wins 1 seat). 32
            Senators are elected by PR in a national party-list vote.
        2.  The Senate oversees the President's conduct of foreign
            policy. Treaty ratification requires a simple majority vote
            of approval (50%+1)
        3.  The Senate has the power to remove and replace (elected)
            state governors and dissolve (elected) state legislatures.
            -   Shortly after 2006 election, amid protests in Oaxaca,
                PRD asks PAN government to throw out corrupt governor,
                refused due to need for support from PRI. Agreed to form
                coalition to throw out governor (Citizen's Movement).

    B.  The Chamber of Deputies (lower house) consists of 500 members.
        They serve three-year terms (one election with President and
        Senators, one off-year)
        1.  300 deputies elected by plurality in SMDs. 200 Deputies
            elected by PR in 5 multi-member districts.
        2.  The Chamber of Deputies must originate revenue bills, and
            has the sole power to appropriate funds (Senate is not
            involved in budget)

    C.  Most bills (other than spending bills) require the approval of
        oth houses, either by a simple majority or a 2/3 supermajority.
        The President has veto power, subject to a 2/3 veto override
        vote.

    D.  Congress is no longer a rubber stamp for the President
        1.  Divided government is possible, usually, no party has a
            majority in either house
        2.  Party Discipline is high in Mexican Congress
            a.  no immeadiate reelection allowed consitutionally
                (accountable to party, not constituency)
            b.  party leadership very important in the nomination
                process - previously no primaries, now there are
            c.  party leaders in Congress control perks (expense
                accounts etc.)

        3.  Today, legislation results from bargaining (on a bill by
            bill basis) among Congressional party leaders and President
            -   most bills now originate in Congress (similar to the US)

IV. The Judiciary
    A.  Historically weak -- but courts have the power to issue an
        amparo (a writ or court order vindicating a citizen's legal or
        constitutional rights)
        -   similar to most Latin American countries, descended from
            Spain
        -   could be used to establish constitutional review

    B.  Growing in importance (decided President could veto a Chamber of
        Deputies spending bill, subject to a 2/3 veto override vote)
    C.  State courts growing in importance as state governments become
        more important

V.  The Military
    A.  Firmly under civilian control
        -   has not had a Junta (as seen in other Latin American
            countries) for a long time (1830s under Santa-Anna)

        1.  Good pay
        2.  Officers allowed to run businesses on side
        3.  Officers rotated often

    B.  Used for political purposes (on occasion) - Tlaltololco Plaza
        Massacre - Chiapas rebels
        -   not on the order of other Latin American countries at the
            time

VI. The Para-Statal Sector

    A.  Even after privitizations, hudreds of semi-autonomous agencies
        and state-owned enterprises provide goods and services

    B.  Examples
        1.  PEMEX (oil and natural gas monopoly)
        2.  NAFIN (investment bank)
        3.  National Electricity Board
