Political Parties
=================

1.  The PRI had no independent role in policy making; function was to
    limit citizen demands on government, secure electoral support for
    the regime and tod distribute rewards to loyal individuals and
    groups.
    -   did not aggregate interests as normally in a democracy (hoped to
        make it seem that way)
    -   political machine, not policy making system
    -   clientelism

2.  Interest groups **not** autonomous
    -   only truly signficant group, the Catholic Church, surpressed

3.  Mexico had a state corporatist system. The PRI had three sectors
    (workers, peasants, white collar)
    -   each dominated by a huge mass organization
        -   Confederación de Trabajadores de México (CTM) (industrial
            worker)
        -   Confederación Nacional Campazinos (CNC) (ejidatarios)
        -   Confederación Nacional de Organizaciones Populares (CNOP)
            (white collar workers/other groups)

    -   citizens were expected to address the state through their mass
        organization (even businesses were organized into
        confederations)

4.  Policy was made by the President and a close circle of advisors.

5.  Individuals and small groups seeking something from the government
    presented their request to "their" sector of the PRI:
    -   this insured that individual demands were granted or denied on
        an individual case-by-case basis; services distributed in a
        discretionary manner
        -   not on a systematic basis as in substatative democracies

    -   this system also insure that broad social groups could not make
        demands on the entire government, could not make collective
        demands
        -   Mexico was not affluent enough to comply with organized
            demands

    -   everyone is reduced to the status of a client handled by a
        patronage system
        -   treats citizens as children
        -   unsustainable as population urbanizes and becomes more
            educated

6.  the system disintegrates (to some extent) when
    -   the state and the PRI lose the funding needed to do the favors
        for people that buy public support (1980s)
    -   autonomous intrest groups develop

7.  When conflicts arose, the state employed several mechanisms to
    resolve them:
    -   accomodation - meet some, but not all, demands on the system
        (bonuses instead of pay raises)
    -   co-optation - bring protesters into the system (Tlaltolco
        students run poverty programs)
        -   if protestors do not join they are marginalized

    -   repression
    -   for long term stability accomodation and co-optation work better
        than repression

8.  Today, labor and campazino organizations remain closely tied to the
    PRI in places (Central and Southern Mexico), at the same time,
    Mexico now has vibrant civil society
